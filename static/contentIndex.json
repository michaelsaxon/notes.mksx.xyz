I worked on social impact problems associated with NLP including the memorization of conspiracy theories [1], measures of transparency in disclosure text around system descriptions [2], balanced training of models under spurious correlations [3] and self-supervised learning objectives that integrate structured knowledge [4]. This year, I continued work in many of those directions, boosted my collaborations, and continued exploring. I switched departments from ECE to CS to better align my affiliation with my advisor’s and my interests. I completed an array of research, coursework, professional development activities that I will detail below.\nIntellectual Merit: I took an additional three courses in the CS department, on web search, adversarial machine learning, and graph machine learning, to further broaden my understanding of computational concepts that may touch my research, and completed my coursework requirement for the CS PhD program.  As I discussed last year, my interests have broadened to encompass understanding how robust representations that are usable in limited-data domains can be trained on natural, potentially biased datasets. To this end, I advanced the direction we started in [3] to study how exactly the natural language inference (NLI) dataset spurious correlation of “relation leakage” manifests. Relation leakage is a problem for the pairwise sentence relation identification task of NLI where subtle biases in the distribution of sentence pairs enables models to accurately guess whether two sentences contradict each other, having only seen one. This type of bias is very difficult to identify and eliminate and it renders progress on NLI questionable. To this end, my primary technical contribution of the year, Relation Leakage in Elicited Natural Language Inference Datasets [5] was submitted to EMNLP 2022. In this work we develop a method for mapping the representation space learned by models trained on these potentially biased NLI datasets in order to quantify the level of relation leakage bias and identify problematic clusters that are locally class imbalanced. In addition to this work I assisted labmates in a wide array of projects that we additionally hope to publish and present in the coming year.\nBroader Impacts:\nI presented my 2020 Amazon internship project to Interspeech in October 2021 [6]. I presented my work from last year on Disclosive Transparency to the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing conference as an oral presentation in November [2]. I presented on Ethics in Artificial Intelligence in a guest lecture to an undergrad machine learning course in March. I advised 5 undergraduate students in their research, helping one student complete a literature review/position piece on transparency in AI, and helping a group of 4 collect a dataset for causal question answering. We plan to submit manuscripts from both of those projects by the end of the academic year. All work that I’ve completed and published since starting the GRF has been made publicly available on the arXiv preprint server, and I will continue to do so. In the next year I hope to further the quality of my own scientific communication directed to the general public.\n[1]  Investigating Conspiracy Theories in Text Generation\nSharon Levy, Michael Saxon, William Yang Wang\nACL Findings 2021\n[2] Modeling Disclosive Transparency in NLP Application Descriptions\nMichael Saxon, Sharon Levy, Xinyi Wang, Alon Albalak, William Yang Wang\nEMNLP 2021 Oral\n[3] Counterfactual Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Training Deep Networks\nXinyi Wang, Wenhu Chen, Michael Saxon, William Yang Wang\nNeurIPS 2021\n[4] Self-Supervised Knowledge Assimilation for Expert-Layman Text Style Transfer\nWenda Xu, Michael Saxon, Misha Sra, William Yang Wang\nAAAI 2022\n[5] Relation Leakage in Elicited Natural Language Inference Datasets\nMichael Saxon, Xinyi Wang, Wenda Xu, William Yang Wang\nPreprint, under review for EMNLP 2022\n[6] End-to-End Spoken Language Understanding for Generalized Voice Assistants\nMichael Saxon, Samridhi Choudhary, Joseph P.

To start, I wanted to tell the story of my health for my research career. This is not a pity party but a documentary effort. Now that I think I have(fingers crossed) closed this chapter of my life, I feel ready to write a bit about it. A lot of this story is about me being stupid. Don’t be stupid like me.\nI had my first seizure when I was 21, on Thanksgiving day my senior year of college. After four days straight of roughly 2-3 hours of sleep a night, I collapsed in the living room while studying for a final. Losing the ability to read while looking at a dense math book is strange---I wasn’t sure if I was just out of my depth or something was actually wrong until I felt a buzzing numb sensation move up my body while trying to sound out the word “the.” As I woke up, I thought my dad was kidding when he told me I had just had a seizure.\nThanksgiving is my favorite holiday. Every year around 15 of my family get together for smoked turkey, pumpkin pie, the works. I must say a soggy vending machine turkey-cranberry sandwich doesn’t quite replace that. However it’s a blessing that it happened when I was home.\nAfter all, I1 actually had my first seizure four months earlier. I was living alone, doing a depressingly boring manual test engineer internship for a defense prime. One night, I recall waking up in a daze, with sore muscles. I was a bit confused but didn’t think much of it, and went to bed. The next day coworkers asked me if I had been in a fight, or had too much to drink---my face was bruised but I couldn’t recall why.\nSimilarly, after The Thanksgiving Seizure I came back with a subconjunctival hemorrhage. It sounds scary for what it is, basically a bruise inside your eyeball that turns the whites of the eye red. It was a great way to get some pity from instructors, collaborators, and friends, but I flunked that final nonetheless and barely passed the course.\nMy first neurologist was ok with me refusing to go on medication. In hindsight, this was an outrageously stupid stance for me to take, but one of my closest friends had also recently become epileptic2 and I had watched the way his witches’ brew of drugs had sapped his vitality and mental speed3 and resolved to avoid this fate at all costs, including risking further seizures.\nI was in denial.\nFor the next few years, I was unmedicated, and had sufficiently infrequent seizures that I could pretend to live a normal life. I stopped driving4 but living in the dense neighborhoods around ASU made this a limited impediment. Through my first four years as an epileptic, I came to live with the roughly 4 to 8 seizures a year. Less than one a month isn’t that bad,\nright??\nI learned to recognize my aura---the signs of a coming episode---over time. It was a loss of the ability to read, speak, or understand speech. It had deja-vu-like sensations, and a feeling that’s almost impossible to put into words, like the sense that my own inner monologue was speaking a tongue I couldn’t understand. These came to be accompanied, of course, by the panic and adrenaline rush of foresight.\nSometimes, I could fight the aura, and avoid a seizure. At least, it felt like I could. I could lay down, clench my fists, stare at the ceiling, and let the sensations pass over me without a seizure. Other times this failed. It probably only felt like I was “beating” them. Illusion of free will and all.\nUnfortunately, my main triggers are stress and sleep deprivation. Not very conducive to the grad student lifestyle, at least as I had been living it. Eventually I learned to cope. Take on less. Give up on a deadline early if it looks like an unsustainable amount of stress would be needed. Sleep more. Oversleep out of an abundance of caution. Seizures would still came but it felt like I had things under control.\nI don’t know exactly how many seizures I had between January 2018 and August 2020. I lived on my own and I was able to handle them at home, lay down on my stomach when I felt them coming, so I wouldn’t choke on my vomit. I still wasn’t medicated, which gave me quite a bit of freedom5. I took an internship in Japan. I worked in Pittsburgh for a little over half a year.\nI completed my masters and applied to PhD programs. Living in Pittsburgh, I took the offer to come back to the west coast to PhD at UCSB. For the pandemic, I moved back home with my parents and did my first year of PhD in my childhood bedroom in Mesa, AZ. Financially this was a good decision, socially I’m not sure, but safety-wise, this turned out to be very prescient.\nI had a seizure where I dislocated my right shoulder. It turns out, the human body is very strong---if you swing your arm straight up and continue rotating backward, with all of your strength, your arm can pull itself out of its own socket. Finally, far too late, I met with a second neurologist to get on my first seizure medication.\nWe don’t have a sophisticated causal understanding of epilepsy. It is a descriptive label to an idiosyncratic set of seizure disorders that can’t be explained by tumors or drugs. Thus, there is no clear way to know a-priori how to treat it. The process of finding a treatment to manage epilepsy is individual and iterative.\nWith my arm in a sling and in the middle of a physical therapy regimen, I moved to Santa Barbara to start my second year of my PhD. I transitioned to a new neurologist and continued the process of slowly ramping up my medicine.\nIt’s a little hard to do research with one arm, but I was mostly able to manage. Lots of people would ask me why my arm was in a sling. I would mumble something about skateboards.\nHaving a low base rate of seizures is a blessing and a curse. You can’t know if a treatment is really working until it fails to stop several seizures. How could I know that the medicine wasn’t increasing my threshold, and I was only still having them from time to time because I was doing something wrong? Maybe I needed to stress less, sleep more? My medicine made me naturally crankier, and raised my brain-mouth barrier6, so I wanted to avoid increasing the dose at all cost.\nUnfortunately, the seizures didn’t stop, and I started dislocating my arm more. After the third or fourth breakthrough seizure, my neurologist convinced me to start raising the dose. We kept cranking it up, hoping the seizures would stop. Maybe they slowed down? It was unclear.\nThey came in embarrassing times. I had to explain to my desk neighbor that I was stopping my work to lay down on my jacket out of an abundance of caution because I had felt the sensations---she didn’t need to worry and if I had a seizure, she needed to only call 911 if it lasted more than a couple minutes. One time, when I was alone in lab, I did have a seizure, and vomited on the carpet. Embarrassed and sore, I wiped it up off the carpet myself, and there’s still a small stain(which thankfully has been covered by a larger stain from an AC leak we had last year).\nOn the maximum dose, they still didn’t stop. I didn’t want to try a new one and risk worsening things. But the dislocations also continued.\nI have observed a scaling law in arm dislocations. The human shoulder has recursive self-improvement in dislocation capabilities. When one happens, it damages the tendons, cartilage, and bones, making the next one easier. By the third or fourth I had, the ER doctor implored me to get reconstructive surgery.\nFiguring that the last thing I should do is let myself mess up the expensive repair job, I finally gave in and agreed to try a new medication.\nI got the surgery, and had the longest period of arm non-use yet.\nThe medicine worked.\nI had the most productive period of my PhD.\nIt has now been a year since my last seizure.\nI can confidently drive again. I feel like I can live long term in the sun belt again.\nI feel like such an idiot. This is all I had to do?! But my obstinance toward drug experimentation is in the past.\nMy life will never be quite the same as it was before, and my experience with epilepsy drove important changes in my life.\nI had to skip an exciting visiting scholar opportunity for my shoulder surgery.\nI have anxieties related to the seizures that will probably not abate for a long time. Every moment of deja vu scares the hell out of me. Weird coping habits I developed linger. I developed the habit of almost always listening to some kind of podcast or speech, just so I could immediately notice if the loss of language understanding has come. Or if I did feel overwhelmed by the aura, I would have something to focus on and maybe beat back the seizure. This auditory safety blanket definitely hampered my ability to sit and ponder, and I am getting used to feeling comfortable without it and sitting in silence.\nThis need for constant audio started with a seizure and hospitalization during one of my summer internships. I feel like learning to work with this coping mechanism played a part in derailing my intern project7.\nMy epilepsy robbed me of music---my most cherished hobby---for years. I have played piano since childhood, producing my own arrangements of music from perfect pitch. As any musician would tell you, sitting at the piano was the ultimate form of active relaxation. In my first year of the PhD, I felt a new set of overwhelming sensations overcome me when I was playing the piano, triggering a seizure. I didn’t touch the piano for several weeks, and when I did again, the same sensation happened. Out of an abundance of caution, I stopped making music completely---I didn’t want to strengthen the connection, and I didn’t want to trigger any unnecessary seizures. I had to mostly stop listening to piano music as I felt like the sensations may start. Once you get in your own head, the fear of feeling the aura, or the doubt of whether a sensation is part of the aura or not, starts to feel like the aura in and of itself. I had to cut it off entirely, and I stopped engaging with music for four years. Should I try again? I want to, but I think I’ll wait longer.\nI think I’m better now though. I certainly hope I am! There’s a bit of survivor’s guilt in that. A friend has had his life be completely derailed by debilitating epilepsy---what right do I have to feel disadvantaged by mine?? How can I feel joy for seemingly “overcoming” my disability while so many continue to suffer?\nI don’t know. I am still struggling with these questions. Writing this was a bit of an act of self-therapy to get over it. I hope to help others like me in my career going forward. I wonder what the best way to do that is. I wonder if I count as disabled. How should I identify myself? Will my epilepsy ever really be “cured?”\nAll I know for now, is that I am extremely grateful looking back on 2024. I was more productive than ever. I made some great friends. And I didn’t have any seizures.

ChatGPT definitely is an advancement in being able to hit that “impressiveness”\n“Towards a benchmark for impressiveness”\n\nEvaluations are already a guiding light for the efforts of researchers.\nWe have more sophisticated needs from systems that require evaluations\nWork on evaluation-guided generation, training have already been shown to take place\n\nThe core story here is we want to ground good middleware tasks in human preferences, but producing a dataset that models these preferences at scale is a grand challenge.\nNLI related work\n\nMulti-Scales (sic) data augmentation for NLI Recent paper I read on the topic, emailed author to cite PECO (low quality, basically a dump of a class project)\nIs Reinforcement Learning (Not) For NLP?* Great jumping-off point, relevant\nConstitutional Learning This is pretty in-the-alignment-panic-weeds, but I think it is valuable to our message, and we have a contribution to build on top of it: reasons to care even if you aren’t  particularly concerned about alignment and x-risks\n\nWilliam 1/7 notes\n\nI have reviewed Jacob Andreas’s position paper.

We are relying on wow factor and impressiveness and human evaluations. This is not scalable, inconsistent at scale, and difficult to use for getting a bird’s eye view\n\nFor example, Chain of Thought is very hot, not understood.\nThis is because it is hot based on wow factor, and generalized ability to answer questions well\n\n\nTheoretical argument, where we assume perfect NLI, perfect human opinion modeling, and outline why this is desirable, how it can be\nLay out the roadmap to getting there\nCan we connect this to interpreting and understanding CoT?\n\n“Nobody can white-box analyze both PALM and ChatGPT on mechanistically why CoT works for them. Neutral auditors/auditing are necessary”\nYes: leverage human tests? Scores for tests are well-defined. Can we generate tests that go beyond academic skills?\nBiG Bench\n“LM Auditing”\nImproving trustworthiness, faithfulness, etc (Build a table listing these possibilities);\n\nWenhu’s program of thought, CMU PAL paper\n“Program” as the middleware is this case\n\nPrograms are accurate\nThey give a deterministic quality to the behavior and serious grounding\n\n\nKnowledge graph as middleware\nDatabase as middleware\nTask-specific classifiers as middleware]\n\nCounterpoints\n\n“Unsafe at Any Accuracy” paper referenced by Bender in “resist dehumanization” talk.

(while there are caveats such as differential lm performance across languages) \nIn the case of parity checks, the same relatively mature metrics for English LM analysis including embedding comparison and LM judging are available.\n \nHowever, many important desiderata are neglected by this approach (as discussed in prior sections).\nWhile translated benchmarks might check for parity on specific translated concepts, they fail when the underlying definition of quality for the task itself is culturally variable. This approach often implicitly imposes the source culture&#039;s definition of &quot;good.&quot;\n \nThese fall under circularity issues, discussed in next section...\n \nIn other words, **representative evaluation is expensive**. This makes the desire to somehow automate this evaluation, ie. via simulated personas and LM judges\n \n\\subsection{Circularity issues in automated metrics}\nLLMs are often trained predominantly on data reflecting dominant (often Western/English) cultural norms and interaction styles.\n \nUsing these same LLMs to judge outputs for different cultural contexts risks reinforcing the dominant norms and failing to recognize culturally appropriate variations. The LLM judges according to the cultural &quot;knowledge&quot; it already possesses, which may be inappropriate or incomplete for the target culture.\n \nThis is especially problematic when evaluating subtle cultural nuances beyond simple factual accuracy.\n \nThe Case for ‘Thick Evaluations’ of Cultural Representation in AI (Qadri et al., 2025)\n \n\\subsection{Limitations of Decontextualized \\&amp; Single-Point Metrics}\n \nThe challenges in evaluating cultural alignment extend beyond the culturally contingent nature of &quot;goodness&quot; to the very metrics and methodologies commonly employed. Standard quantitative metrics prevalent in NLP evaluation, such as accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, or ROUGE, prove fundamentally insufficient when assessing the nuances of cultural competence. Their primary drawback lies in their decontextualized nature. Cultural appropriateness is inherently tied to the specific situation, interactional dynamics, audience expectations, and implicit social cues – elements largely stripped away by metrics designed to measure lexical overlap with a reference text or adherence to a predefined factual label. A statement, for instance, might be factually accurate according to a gold standard but delivered in a manner that is culturally inappropriate, offensive, or simply nonsensical given the context; standard metrics are blind to such critical distinctions.\n \nFurthermore, these metrics often operate under the implicit assumption of a singular &quot;correct&quot; or optimal output. However, as discussed, culturally situated interactions frequently allow for, or even necessitate, a plurality of valid responses reflecting diverse perspectives, communication styles, or acceptable social norms within a given culture. Reducing evaluation to a single score against a predefined target obscures this crucial aspect of cultural competence and risks penalizing valid, culturally-attuned variations simply because they deviate from an arbitrarily chosen reference. This raises the question of whether the goal should always be assessing correctness or quality on a linear scale, or perhaps identifying what is definitely not acceptable – defining the boundaries of harmful or inappropriate behavior within a specific cultural frame.\n \nBeyond the metrics themselves, the dominant benchmark methodology – typically involving isolated, single-turn query-response pairs evaluated independently – fails to reveal important systemic behaviors or interaction patterns. Evaluating models based on aggregated scores from thousands of discrete test items can overlook consistent biases, stereotypical tendencies, or peculiar behavioral quirks that only emerge when observing responses across multiple related queries or during extended interactions. For example, Myung et al. (2024) observed a form of stereotypical fixation where, when queried about West Java, an LLM frequently defaulted to answering various food-related questions with `Seblak,&#039; one of the most famous dishes from the region. This tendency illustrates a pattern—providing seemingly relevant traditional information without fully grasping the specific context—that is unlikely to be captured by evaluating individual answers in isolation but points to a potential systemic issue in the model&#039;s nuanced understanding or knowledge representation. Such potentially problematic patterns, reflecting underlying biases or skewed knowledge representations, cannot be adequately identified or measured through single-instance evaluations focused solely on the correctness or quality of individual answers. Detecting these requires methods designed to systematically probe for and analyze patterns in model behavior across a spectrum of relevant inputs and interaction contexts.\n \nConsequently, relying solely on decontextualized performance scores and single-point evaluation paradigms risks painting an incomplete, and potentially misleading, picture of a model&#039;s true cultural capabilities and limitations. This necessitates a fundamental shift towards evaluation approaches that embrace context, acknowledge response plurality, and are capable of identifying broader behavioral patterns, demanding the &quot;thicker&quot; forms of evaluation we explore next.\n \n% Our suggestions\nGiven the cultural contingency of quality definitions and the limitations of decontextualized metrics and single-point benchmark evaluations, we must move towards richer, more situated assessment methodologies. Drawing inspiration from concepts like &quot;thick evaluation,&quot; as explored by Qadri et al. (2025) in the context of AI-generated cultural representations, offers a promising direction. This involves shifting away from singular notions of accuracy towards multi-dimensional frameworks that capture aspects like cultural missingness, specificity, coherence, and connotation, alongside correctness. Building on this, we suggest complementing the search for &quot;good&quot; outputs by identifying negative boundaries—systematically detecting responses that are culturally unacceptable, harmful, or nonsensical within specific contexts. Furthermore, particularly when comparing across cultures and languages, we advocate for employing more qualitative and comparative metrics that assess factors beyond simple performance parity. For instance, recent work highlights significant disparities in the sheer quantity of factual information models generate across different languages (Shafayat et al., 2024), suggesting that merely achieving similar accuracy scores might obscure underlying inequities in informational scope. Moreover, as noted by Shafayat et al. (2024), current factual evaluations often fail to differentiate the granularity or informational value of facts, treating highly specific statements (e.g., “Person X attended MIT”) the same as generic ones (e.g., “Person X attended a renowned university”). Assessing these factors—granularity, scope, and nuance—is crucial for a deeper understanding of cross-cultural capabilities. Adopting such &quot;thicker&quot; approaches inherently recognizes evaluation not just as a technical measurement, but as a contextualized process deeply intertwined with the perspectives and social locations of those involved, demanding careful consideration of who evaluates and under what conditions.\n% Metrics are supposed to measure an external construct of interest, but this assumption is often left unchallenged [refs in 1].\n% &quot;Values pluralism&quot; [1] makes it hard to get coherent samples that represent this multivariate problem space. \n% There are a lot of axes under which this problem can hold."},"01-Fleeting-Notes/D3JS-Notes":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/D3JS-Notes","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/D3JS Notes.md","title":"D3JS Notes","links":["tags/tool-learning"],"tags":["tool-learning"],"content":"2023-01-29 17:02\nTags: tool-learning\n\nwattenberger.com/blog/d3#manipulating-data\nwww.newline.co/fullstack-d3\nwww.w3schools.com/js/js_graphics_d3js.asp\nBuilding scatterplot for PECO\nd3-graph-gallery.com/graph/interactivity_tooltip.html\ntwitter.com/Wattenberger/status/1619729834153746432\n\nexample that has a lot of what i want.

I imagine he would simply argue he’s a realist about human nature. And, indeed, studies showing that “skilled” analysts are hopeless at predicting the price of shares have yet to translate into mass sackings or even reduced bonuses on Wall Street or in the City. The same goes for evidence that the influence of a high-quality CEO on the performance of a company is barely greater than chance.\n\n\nBut there are more modest ways his insights can help us avoid making mistakes. He advises, for example, that meetings start with participants writing down their ideas about the issue at hand before anyone speaks. That way, the halo effect – whereby the concerns raised first and most assertively dominate the discussion – can be mitigated, and a range of views considered. Then there is the concept of adversarial collaboration, an attempt to do away with pointless academic feuding. Though he doesn’t like to think in terms of leaving a legacy, it’s one thing he says he hopes to be remembered for. In the early 2000s Kahneman sought out a leading opponent of his view that so-called expert judgments were frequently flawed. Gary Klein’s research focused on the ability of professionals such as firefighters to make intuitive but highly skilled judgments in difficult circumstances. “We spent five or six years trying to figure out the boundary, where he’s right, where I am right. And that was a very satisfying experience. We wrote a paper entitled ‘A Failure to Disagree’”.\n\n“If I could use a magic wand and get rid of one thing, it would be overconfidence”\nWhy I’m Not worried about superintelligence blogpost\n\nWhat’s fascinating is that Kahneman’s work explicitly swims against the current of human thought. Not even he believes that the various flaws that bedevil decision-making can be successfully corrected. The most damaging of these is overconfidence: the kind of optimism that leads governments to believe that wars are quickly winnable and capital projects will come in on budget despite statistics predicting exactly the opposite. It is the bias he says he would most like to eliminate if he had a magic wand. But it “is built so deeply into the structure of the mind that you couldn’t change it without changing many other things”.\n"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Definition-problem-in-killer-robot-ban":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Definition-problem-in-killer-robot-ban","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Definition problem in killer robot ban.md","title":"Definition problem in killer robot ban","links":["tags/writing-ideas","tags/transparency","tags/definitions"],"tags":["writing-ideas","transparency","definitions"],"content":"Definition problem in killer robot ban\n2022-04-23 16:44\nTags: writing-ideas transparency definitions\n\nRao wrote an article for the guardian in 2017 about why he is reluctant to sign a “killer robot ban,” and a part of the reason why is that it’s poorly defined and not actionable.\n\nApart from the difficulty of pinning down exactly what the ban entails for states that want to follow it – is the ban against autonomy or intelligence? – I wonder about the ban’s ability to deter misuse by rogue state or non-state actors.\n\n(Link)"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Demo-Track-p37":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Demo-Track-p37","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Demo Track p37.md","title":"Demo Track p37","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Abstract def of CoT is a little off---it’s intermediate step explanations, not example explanations.\nPerformance hindered by intermediate errors in the explanation steps.

After all, you would have to try an INSANE amount of randomly sampled mp3-encoded binary files before you could recover a specific target audio.\nThis “diffusion model as (keyed noise, prompt) → (exact image)” interpretation I think supports the argument that memorization isn’t really the function of the model. The image itself isn’t inside the model any more than “Never Gonna Give You Up” isn’t stored in the MP3 algorithm.\nIts just that the learned init pix+prompt → image map is very complicated and incomprehensible, learned via diffusion training process, and as a byproduct produces a uesful generalization.\n\nI think it’s possible that every training sample is “memorized” in the sense that there could exist a (noise initialization, prompt) pair to recover every training image.\nInit pixels rather than the model weights as compressed image⇒lossy, negative compression rate?\n\nI think this interpretation is further supported by altclip’s shocking similarity across languages in their controlled init noise experiments\nTHAT BEING SAID: if this interpretation is correct, the fact that Wallace and friends are so capable of performing this attack to find the inversion is SHOCKING. Imagine using this output similarity attack (with no prior knowledge about the MP3 algorithm) trying to find a matching mp3 binary encoding to match a wav file. Impossible.\nThere’s probably lots of redundancy built in to this mapping and the performance of this dumb search method suggests there’s more going on.\nHowever, at the end of the day, the recoverability of a specific training image given a specific noise init supporting the compression + interpolation interpretation suggests to me that handling this is memorization by the model is not the right way to treat handling, regulating, responding etc to these model\nPhilosophy of memorization\nhow is Fig1 diff from “memorized” llama that’s a different colorkj\nFrom messenger\nI have no intuition for how reusable subelements of the mapping function from semantic conditioned noise to image is for memorization… could be very high\nImportant distinction against mp3 algo is that the input noise thats being “decompressed” is not correlated at all with the final output. But it’s gaining info from prompt+2GB of weights\nAnd 2gb of memo images is nothing, but 2GB of pure function implementation is massive\nUseful to have a principle for noise similarity\n\nSince input and output are in image space, L2 metric is good for all points\nL2 similarity is useful for guarantee of Lipschitz smoothness (bounded by difference on output)\nAgrees that targetting what the true meaning of memorization actually is for generative image (conditioned on noise) in diffusion models is the right direction\n\nWould it be possible to estimate the bits of information carried internally and externally?\nProject Coordination\nMapping is not memorization\nTasks for “Mapping is not Memorization”\nwww.kaggle.com/datasets/denislukovnikov/celebahq256-images-only\nShutterstock memorization by model twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1637321077553606657\narxiv.org/abs/2208.11970\n\nUnderstanding diffusion models\n"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Do-AI-systems-really-have-their-own-language":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Do-AI-systems-really-have-their-own-language","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Do AI systems really have their own language?.md","title":"Do AI systems really have their own language?","links":["tags/language-model","tags/pretraining","tags/prompting","tags/summary"],"tags":["language-model","pretraining","prompting","summary"],"content":"Do AI systems really have their own language?\n2022-10-10 18:21\nTags: language-model pretraining prompting summary\n\nAn article by Aaron J.

This work revolved around the goal of producing meaningful evaluations of new capabilities that are difficult to measure in multimodal and text-only language models.\nAmong the most interesting results, our NeurIPS paper overturned the conventional wisdom in text-to-image model evaluation: fancy, expensive LM-based metrics fail to outperform simple correlation-based ones at actually detecting consequential differences between images (the actual domain in which they are deployed); their superiority was an illusory artifact of poor meta-evaluation.\nMy work has also been impactful outside the academy. My COLM paper was a position piece on the problems of AI system evaluation, particularly the lack of scientifically rigorous approaches to intelligence benchmarking in real-world contexts. This paper has already received considerable attention, including being referenced as a guide within an Open Philanthropy call for grant proposals for AI safety.

Anything can be excused from appealing to the incentives.\nData fabrication, threats, sabotage, etc\n\nIf we’re not comfortable with pariahs like Stapel blaming The Incentives for causing them to fabricate data, we shouldn’t use The Incentives as an excuse for doing things that are on the same spectrum, albeit less severe.

These contain actions that can be performed, which take in parameters, have preconditions, and lead to effects, e.g. this action definition for picking up an object:\n\nThis is a simple class of planning models that doesn’t contain object types, only has simple preconditions, and doesn’t have conditional effects\n\nApproach\nThey decompose their approach into a lifted, domain-agnostic definition of component classes, and then domain-dependent components that require specific development.\n\nThey define lifted models using PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) and compatible structurd inputs\nDomain-dependent element converts these abstractions into domain-specific natural language and back out\n\n\nEditorializing : I think the DDC is much more critical to success than the DIC; if the model outputs aren’t properly translated for reasoning evaluation, it all breaks\nDomain Model\nLifted, describes\n\nthe available actions to solve any planning problem\npredicates that can describe relationships to objects\navailable object types\n\nProblem Generator\nNeeds to produce a domain-specific planning problem, which includes the following:\n\nDescription of objects\nInitial state\nGoal description\nValid solution\n\nTranslator\nNeeds to convert the generated test cases into natlang and the model outputs back out of natlang to evaluate performance.\nThey use a templating-based mechanism to achieve this, with a template for each:\n\npredicate\naction\nstate/plan (by concatenating the above)\n\nTest curriculum\nAt present, their testbench provides 7 different cases (domains?)\n\nGoal-directed reasoning - Can the LLM come up with valid plans that will achieve a specific goal?\nCost Optimal Planning - Can the LLM come up with plans that are optimal to achieve a specific goal?\nReasoning about plan execution - Can the LLM reason about what happens when a plan is executed?\nRobustness to goal reformulation - Can the LLM recognize the same goal when specified in different ways?\nAbility to reuse plans - Can the LLM recognize scenarios where it can reuse part or the whole of the original plan to achieve the new goal?\nReplanning - Can the LLM replan for cases where an unexpected change is reported?\nPlan Generalization - Can the LLM take specific plans, extract underlying procedural patterns and apply them to a new instance?\n\n1. and 2. correspond to real planning problems, while the others correspond to simple auxiliary tasks.\nThey ground their tasks based on colored block manipulation in the blocksworld domain. In a blocksworld problem, a set of blocks are placed either on a table or on top of each other. The goal is to arrange them in a stack in a particular order.\nBlocks may only be picked up if they are clear, i.e. have no other blocks stacked on top of them. Every prompt begins with a description of the blockworld problem space:\n\nThey provide one single prompt that demonstrates how the validly-formed steps are phrased, followed by the actual query they test:\n\nI will explain below how the various cases (2-7) differ from the first sample after first covering how the plan extraction works.\nTo do this, they use plan validator tools like: VAL: Automatic plan validation using PDDL . This is essentially a mixture of forcing a certain structure:\n\nOne action per line\nOne verb per action\nFixed action vocabulary\n\nSo that the correct actions may be inverted\nEditorializing: I believe that there are a few issues with this approach.\n\nIs there a demonstration that the failures are “reasonable” failures and not “glitches”?\nAka, is it getting structure right and failing on the understanding or just failing to grasp the correct structure?\nThe analysis section on this is a little limited.\n\nOther task descriptions\n\nOptimal planning: same as the base case, but now a cost is assigned to each action. (In this case, in time), and in the prompt they mention things like “finishing as fast as possible” or other ways to specify that time is of the essence. They also then include the cost of the plan as compared to the optimal cost in the eval\nReasoning about plan execution: answer a question about the generated sequence, seemingly of form true/false. In this case, the action sequence is provided to the model, and all it needs to do is answer questions like “Is the statement, ‘the blue block is on top of the orange block’ true?”\nRobustness to goal formulation: They provide an identical problem to the example, where all they do is reorder/rephrase the the goal, or only include a subset of the goal specification (in which case same plan would work)\nAbility to reuse plans: same as before, but the prefix of the sample is the whole solution\n\nIn the sample they provide, there is an example of an affordance error, where it tries unstacking a block off a stack that doesn’t exist (blue isn’t on top of red)\n\n\nReplanning: this one moves off into wonky territory. They introduce intermediate PLAN END tags where they describe “During execution, an unexpected event has occurred.” followed by what happened eg a block fell or something was dropped. They don’t use words like “dropped” to articulate this. This may be an unfair task\n\nThey put GPT-3 in at the “After re-planning a new state…” here\nThere may be fairer ways to prompt-engineer this one.\n\n\nPlan generalization:\n\nThey implement pseudo-examples of things like loops of repeated actions and see if they generalize to a condition where one element of init is different. These often do not work.\nSimilar wonkiness here, will elaborate further tmrw.\n\n\n\nResults\n"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Lab-Meeting-3-12-Nick-Roberts":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Lab-Meeting-3-12-Nick-Roberts","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Lab Meeting 3-12 Nick Roberts.md","title":"Lab Meeting 3-12 Nick Roberts","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Science of scaling laws\nAre compute optima skill-dependent?\nMeta internship project Paper link (pdf)\nSkills are described as specific capacities:\n\nKnowledge QA\nReasoning\n\nCode as a proxy for reasoning\n\n\n\nCompute needs differ between these different skills.

Ford of the Ford Instrument Company and William Newell. It was used on a variety of ships, ranging from destroyers (one per ship) to battleships (four per ship). The Mark 37 system used tachymetric target motion prediction to compute a fire control solution. It contained a target simulator which was updated by further target tracking until it matched.\nWeighing more than 3,000 pounds (1,400 kg), the Mark 1 itself was installed in the plotting room, a watertight compartment that was located deep inside the ship’s hull to provide as much protection against battle damage as possible.\nEssentially an electromechanical analog computer, the Mark 1 was electrically linked to the gun mounts and the Mark 37 gun director, the latter mounted as high on the superstructure as possible to afford maximum visual and radar range. The gun director was equipped with both optical and radar range finding, and was able to rotate on a small barbette-like structure. Using the range finders and telescopes for bearing and elevation, the director was able to produce a continuously varying set of outputs, referred to as line-of-sight (LOS) data, that were electrically relayed to the Mark 1 via synchro motors. The LOS data provided the target’s present range, bearing, and in the case of aerial targets, altitude. Additional inputs to the Mark 1A were continuously generated from the stable element, a gyroscopic device that reacted to the roll and pitch of the ship, the pitometer log, which measured the ship’s speed through the water, and an anemometer, which provided wind speed and direction. The Stable Element would now be called a vertical gyro.\nIn “Plot” (the plotting room), a team of sailors stood around the four-foot-tall (1.2 m) Mark 1 and continuously monitored its operation. They would also be responsible for calculating and entering the average muzzle velocity of the projectiles to be fired before action started. This calculation was based on the type of propellant to be used and its temperature, the projectile type and weight, and the number of rounds fired through the guns to date.\nGiven these inputs, the Mark 1 automatically computed the lead angles to the future position of the target at the end of the projectile’s time of flight, adding in corrections for gravity, relative wind, the magnus effect of the spinning projectile, and parallax, the latter compensation necessary because the guns themselves were widely displaced along the length of the ship. Lead angles and corrections were added to the LOS data to generate the line-of-fire (LOF) data. The LOF data, bearing and elevation, as well as the projectile’s fuze time, was sent to the mounts by synchro motors, whose motion actuated hydraulic servos with excellent dynamic accuracy to aim the guns.\nOnce the system was “locked” on the target, it produced a continuous fire control solution. While these fire control systems greatly improved the long-range accuracy of ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore gunfire, especially on heavy cruisers and battleships, it was in the anti-aircraft warfare mode that the Mark 1 made the greatest contribution. However, the anti-aircraft value of analog computers such as the Mark 1 was greatly reduced with the introduction of jet aircraft, where the relative motion of the target became such that the computer’s mechanism could not react quickly enough to produce accurate results. Furthermore, the target speed, originally limited to 300 knots by a mechanical stop, was twice doubled to 600, then 1,200 knots by gear ratio changes.\nThe design of the postwar Mark 1A may have been influenced by the Bell Labs Mark 8, which was developed as an all electrical computer, incorporating technology from the M9 gun data computer as a safeguard to ensure adequate supplies of fire control computers for the USN during WW2. Surviving Mark 1 computers were upgraded to the Mark 1A standard after World War II ended.\nAmong the upgrades were removing the vector solver from the Mark 1 and redesigning the reverse coordinate conversion scheme that updated target parameters.\nThe scheme kept the four component integrators, obscure devices not included in explanations of basic fire control mechanisms. They worked like a ball–type computer mouse, but had shaft inputs to rotate the ball and to determine the angle of its axis of rotation.\nThe round target course indicator on the right side of the star shell computer with the two panic buttons is a holdover from WW II days when early tracking data and initial angle–output position of the vector solver caused target speed to decrease. Pushbuttons slewed the vector solver quickly."},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Meditation-on-feeling-useless-in-AI-research":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Meditation-on-feeling-useless-in-AI-research","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Meditation on feeling useless in AI research.md","title":"Meditation on feeling useless in AI research","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Many people who worked in AI slightly earlier on are benefiting a lot from working on the “current thing”\nLiving through AI being “the current thing” has been exhausting.\n\nThe panic and massive influx of tourists/neophytes freaking out about xrisk etc\nThe massive amount of attention that Yudtypes have gotten, sucking the air out of the room\nThe gulf between SOTA industry shit and what feels achievable as a PhD student\nDisconnect between what I care about and the kind of work that gets rewarded\n\nventurebeat.com/ai/why-ai-is-teetering-on-the-edge-of-a-disillusionment-cliff-the-ai-beat/\nFeels like the “point” of making good text generation is so hollow: it’s just going to allow us to fill the world with so much more meaningless bullshit"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Metrics-for-T2I-Verb-Assessment":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Metrics-for-T2I-Verb-Assessment","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Metrics for T2I Verb Assessment.md","title":"Metrics for T2I Verb Assessment","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Problem with TIFA is that the in-context examples are all faithful\nNovelty is finding relational hallucination between objects and correcting\ngithub.com/BradyFU/Woodpecker\nA/B test on natural image + prompt ⇒ generate new img = new generated image from prompt that is potentially unfaithful\nbrowse.arxiv.org/pdf/2306.14060.pdf\nFaithfulRefCOCO\nopenreview.net/pdf\nFour directions:\n\nVQA (eg, TIFA)\nObject Detection (MDTER, direct run of an object detection method)\nSegmentation\nImage description model (captioning, extract structured description, and then handle with LLM etc)\n\nbrowse.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06394.pdf\n\nOther work does hallucination shit\nCan we characterize different hallucinations\n\nObject hallucination\nAttribute hallucination\nRelational hallucination\nVerbal hallucination\n\n\nJust searching through a bunch of papers with “mitigating hallucination in vision-language”\n\nI forgot to mention the POPE paper:\ngithub.com/RUCAIBox/POPE\narxiv.org/abs/2305.10355\nNiket:\n\nQuestions that bring out the diff faithfully?\nE2E RL to get a policy that generates those good diffs\nAnd getting these from extracted information\nAugmenting TIFA with questions that lead toward reasoning\nExtend to “is it safe?”\nFocus on safety is a big deal for the community\nFor self-correcting the vision side might grow\nGDCE Generate Discriminate Critique Edit\nThese different benchmarks\n\n\nLooking at alignment to papers I’ve read and cited and focused on\nWhere do I see opportunities to transfer what I’ve worked on to somewhere else\nPropose something out of the box that appeals\n\nExample (I want to work on these multimodal models that deal with scientific diagrams)\n\n\n\nMaking future NLI:\n\nAdding a “contested” label\nFinding HARD examples, so hard even humans may disagree\nMultimoda\n\nMultilinguality in T2I:\n\nLook for word2vec-like relational semantic geometry as evidence for “alignable” Emu-like finetuning\n"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Michael-Jordan-Campus-Visit-Notes":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Michael-Jordan-Campus-Visit-Notes","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Michael Jordan Campus Visit Notes.md","title":"Michael Jordan Campus Visit Notes","links":["tags/visitor","tags/talk-notes"],"tags":["visitor","talk-notes"],"content":"2023-01-17 16:32\nTags: visitor talk-notes\n\nTalk 1\nan engineering field:\n\nscaling new possibilities with building blocks from fundamental sciences\ncomparable to chemE and EE from scientific principles\nQ: It seems like we’re not building the field on scientific principles that are as fundamental\nunique problem: - empirical findings without theory\n\nhow to transition from alchemy to chemistry\n\n\n\nHis A to my Q:\n\nGood example from this maket-level thinking\n\namazon is able to close the empirical and theoretical gap in massive supply chain and deliveries throughout the world\nThis is a domain where it has emerged\nHealthcare, “people would like it to emerge” (it hasn’t)\n\n\nGood point that it isn’t divorced in all subregions (I am DL fixated)\n“This is the most exciting engineering field to be building because humans are so inherently involved”\nThis is where the “economic ideas” and “data flows at planetary scale” fit in\n\nThe issue\nInteresting point too:\n\ndecisions on competition\nuber accidentally makes fastest route slowest by sending people that way\n“Who do you choose?

Pieler, Anbang Ye, Ian Yang, Spencer Frazier, Mark O. Riedl\narXiv.org 2022\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Controlled automated story generation seeks to generate natural language stories satisfying constraints from natural language critiques or preferences. Existing methods to control for story preference utilize prompt engineering which is labor intensive and often inconsistent. They may also use logit-manipulation methods which require annotated datasets to exist for the desired attributes. To address these issues, we first train a contrastive bi-encoder model to align stories with corresponding human critiques, named CARP, building a general purpose preference model. This is subsequently used as a reward function to fine-tune a generative language model via reinforcement learning. However, simply fine-tuning a generative language model with a contrastive reward model does not always reliably result in a story generation system capable of generating stories that meet user preferences. To increase story generation robustness we further fine-tune the contrastive reward model using a prompt-learning technique. A human participant study is then conducted comparing generations from our full system, ablations, and two baselines. We show that the full fine-tuning pipeline results in a story generator preferred over a LLM 20x as large as well as logit-based methods. This motivates the use of contrastive learning for general purpose human preference modeling.\n\n\n\nCreativity and Machine Learning: A Survey\nGiorgio Franceschelli, Mirco Musolesi\nACM Computing Surveys 2021\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   There is a growing interest in the area of machine learning and creativity.

Zhang\nTrans. Mach. Learn. Res. 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Generative foundation models are susceptible to implicit biases that can arise from extensive unsupervised training data. Such biases can produce suboptimal samples, skewed outcomes, and unfairness, with potentially serious consequences. Consequently, aligning these models with human ethics and preferences is an essential step toward ensuring their responsible and effective deployment in real-world applications. Prior research has primarily employed Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to address this problem, where generative models are fine-tuned with RL algorithms guided by a human-feedback-informed reward model. However, the inefficiencies and instabilities associated with RL algorithms frequently present substantial obstacles to the successful alignment, necessitating the development of a more robust and streamlined approach. To this end, we introduce a new framework, Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT), designed to align generative models effectively. Utilizing a reward model and a sufficient number of samples, our approach selects the high-quality samples, discarding those that exhibit undesired behavior, and subsequently enhancing the model by fine-tuning on these filtered samples. Our studies show that RAFT can effectively improve the model performance in both reward learning and other automated metrics in both large language models and diffusion models.\n\n\n\nMusicRL: Aligning Music Generation to Human Preferences\nGeoffrey Cideron, Sertan Girgin, Mauro Verzetti, Damien Vincent, Matej Kastelic, Zalán Borsos, Brian McWilliams, Victor Ungureanu, Olivier Bachem, O. Pietquin, Matthieu Geist, L’eonard Hussenot, Neil Zeghidour, A. Agostinelli\nInternational Conference on Machine Learning 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   We propose MusicRL, the first music generation system finetuned from human feedback. Appreciation of text-to-music models is particularly subjective since the concept of musicality as well as the specific intention behind a caption are user-dependent (e.g. a caption such as&quot;upbeat work-out music&quot;can map to a retro guitar solo or a techno pop beat). Not only this makes supervised training of such models challenging, but it also calls for integrating continuous human feedback in their post-deployment finetuning. MusicRL is a pretrained autoregressive MusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023) model of discrete audio tokens finetuned with reinforcement learning to maximise sequence-level rewards. We design reward functions related specifically to text-adherence and audio quality with the help from selected raters, and use those to finetune MusicLM into MusicRL-R. We deploy MusicLM to users and collect a substantial dataset comprising 300,000 pairwise preferences. Using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), we train MusicRL-U, the first text-to-music model that incorporates human feedback at scale. Human evaluations show that both MusicRL-R and MusicRL-U are preferred to the baseline. Ultimately, MusicRL-RU combines the two approaches and results in the best model according to human raters. Ablation studies shed light on the musical attributes influencing human preferences, indicating that text adherence and quality only account for a part of it. This underscores the prevalence of subjectivity in musical appreciation and calls for further involvement of human listeners in the finetuning of music generation models.\n\n\n\nBeyond Thumbs Up/Down: Untangling Challenges of Fine-Grained Feedback for Text-to-Image Generation\nKatherine M.

Dvijotham\nAAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Human feedback plays a critical role in learning and refining reward models for text-to-image generation, but the optimal form the feedback should take for learning an accurate reward function has not been conclusively established. This paper investigates the effectiveness of fine-grained feedback which captures nuanced distinctions in image quality and prompt-alignment, compared to traditional coarse-grained feedback (for example, thumbs up/down or ranking between a set of options). While fine-grained feedback holds promise, particularly for systems catering to diverse societal preferences, we show that demonstrating its superiority to coarse-grained feedback is not automatic. Through experiments on real and synthetic preference data, we surface the complexities of building effective models due to the interplay of model choice, feedback type, and the alignment between human judgment and computational interpretation. We identify key challenges in eliciting and utilizing fine-grained feedback, prompting a reassessment of its assumed benefits and practicality. Our findings -- e.g., that fine-grained feedback can lead to worse models for a fixed budget, in some settings; however, in controlled settings with known attributes, fine grained rewards can indeed be more helpful -- call for careful consideration of feedback attributes and potentially beckon novel modeling approaches to appropriately unlock the potential value of fine-grained feedback in-the-wild.\n\n\n\nControllable Neural Story Plot Generation via Reward Shaping\nAnimesh Mehta, Mark O. Riedl, Brent Harrison, Lara J. Martin, Murtaza Dhuliawala, Pradyumna Tambwekar\nInternational Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2018\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Language-modeling--based approaches to story plot generation attempt to construct a plot by sampling from a language model (LM) to predict the next character, word, or sentence to add to the story. LM techniques lack the ability to receive guidance from the user to achieve a specific goal, resulting in stories that don&#039;t have a clear sense of progression and lack coherence. We present a reward-shaping technique that analyzes a story corpus and produces intermediate rewards that are backpropagated into a pre-trained LM in order to guide the model toward a given goal. Automated evaluations show our technique can create a model that generates story plots which consistently achieve a specified goal. Human-subject studies show that the generated stories have more plausible event ordering than baseline plot generation techniques.\n\n\n\nFailures Are Fated, But Can Be Faded: Characterizing and Mitigating Unwanted Behaviors in Large-Scale Vision and Language Models\nSom Sagar, Aditya Taparia, Ransalu Senanayake\nInternational Conference on Machine Learning 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   In large deep neural networks that seem to perform surprisingly well on many tasks, we also observe a few failures related to accuracy, social biases, and alignment with human values, among others. Therefore, before deploying these models, it is crucial to characterize this failure landscape for engineers to debug and legislative bodies to audit models. Nevertheless, it is infeasible to exhaustively test for all possible combinations of factors that could lead to a model&#039;s failure. In this paper, we introduce a post-hoc method that utilizes \\emph{deep reinforcement learning} to explore and construct the landscape of failure modes in pre-trained discriminative and generative models. With the aid of limited human feedback, we then demonstrate how to restructure the failure landscape to be more desirable by moving away from the discovered failure modes. We empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed method across common Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Vision-Language tasks.\n\n\n\nGenerative Reward Models\nAlon Albalak, Dakota Mahan, Jan-Philipp Franken, Chelsea Finn, Duy Phung, Chase Blagden, Nathan Lile, Louis Castricato, Rafael Rafailov\narXiv.org 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has greatly improved the performance of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). The RLHF process is resource-intensive and technically challenging, generally requiring a large collection of human preference labels over model-generated outputs. Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) addresses this data collection challenge by leveraging synthetic preferences generated by an LLM. However, recent work has shown that synthetic preferences labels may not align well with human preference judgments. To address this, we propose a hybrid approach that unifies RLHF and RLAIF methodologies. We introduce GenRM, an iterative algorithm that trains an LLM on self-generated reasoning traces, leading to synthetic preference labels matching human preference judgments. Empirically, we show that zero-shot LLM-based judgments under-perform compared to Bradley-Terry reward models on in-distribution tasks (between 9-36%). In contrast, GenRM achieves in-distribution accuracy comparable to Bradley-Terry models, while significantly outperforming them on out-of-distribution tasks (between 10-45%). Moreover, GenRM surpasses the performance of using LLMs as judges on both in-distribution (by 9-31%) and out-of-distribution tasks (by 2- 6%). Our results show that combining the strengths of RLHF and RLAIF offers a promising approach for improving the quality of synthetic preference labels.\n\n\n\nReinforcement Learning With LLMs Interaction For Distributed Diffusion Model Services\nHongyang Du, Ruichen Zhang, D. Niyato, Jiawen Kang, Zehui Xiong, Shuguang Cui, Xuemin Shen, Dong In Kim\nunknown 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Distributed Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) has attracted significant attention, but two key challenges remain: maximizing subjective Quality of Experience (QoE) and improving energy efficiency, which are particularly pronounced in widely adopted Generative Diffusion Model (GDM)-based image generation services. In this paper, we propose a novel user-centric Interactive AI (IAI) approach for service management, with a distributed GDM-based AIGC framework that emphasizes efficient and cooperative deployment. The proposed method restructures the GDM inference process by allowing users with semantically similar prompts to share parts of the denoising chain. Furthermore, to maximize the users&#039; subjective QoE, we propose an IAI approach, i.e., Reinforcement Learning With Large Language Models Interaction (RLLI), which utilizes Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered generative agents to replicate user interaction, providing real-time and subjective QoE feedback aligned with diverse user personalities. Lastly, we present the GDM-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (GDDPG) algorithm, adapted to the proposed RLLI framework, to allocate communication and computing resources effectively while accounting for subjective user traits and dynamic wireless conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that G-DDPG improves total QoE by 15% compared with the standard DDPG algorithm.\n\n\n\nNo Metrics Are Perfect: Adversarial Reward Learning for Visual Storytelling\nXin Eric Wang, Wenhu Chen, Yuan-fang Wang, William Yang Wang\nAnnual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics 2018\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Though impressive results have been achieved in visual captioning, the task of generating abstract stories from photo streams is still a little-tapped problem. Different from captions, stories have more expressive language styles and contain many imaginary concepts that do not appear in the images. Thus it poses challenges to behavioral cloning algorithms. Furthermore, due to the limitations of automatic metrics on evaluating story quality, reinforcement learning methods with hand-crafted rewards also face difficulties in gaining an overall performance boost. Therefore, we propose an Adversarial REward Learning (AREL) framework to learn an implicit reward function from human demonstrations, and then optimize policy search with the learned reward function. Though automatic evaluation indicates slight performance boost over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in cloning expert behaviors, human evaluation shows that our approach achieves significant improvement in generating more human-like stories than SOTA systems.\n\n\n\nIs Crowdsourcing Breaking Your Bank? Cost-Effective Fine-Tuning of Pre-trained Language Models with Proximal Policy Optimization\nShuo Yang, Gjergji Kasneci\nInternational Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Wide usage of ChatGPT has highlighted the potential of reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, its training pipeline relies on manual ranking, a resource-intensive process. To reduce labor costs, we propose a self-supervised text ranking approach for applying Proximal-Policy-Optimization to fine-tune language models while eliminating the need for human annotators. Our method begins with probabilistic sampling to encourage a language model to generate diverse responses for each input. We then employ TextRank and ISODATA algorithms to rank and cluster these responses based on their semantics. Subsequently, we construct a reward model to learn the rank and optimize our generative policy. Our experimental results, conducted using two language models on three tasks, demonstrate that the models trained by our method considerably outperform baselines regarding BLEU, GLEU, and METEOR scores. Furthermore, our manual evaluation shows that our ranking results exhibit a remarkably high consistency with that of humans. This research significantly reduces training costs of proximal policy-guided models and demonstrates the potential for self-correction of language models.\n\n\n\nPlot and Rework: Modeling Storylines for Visual Storytelling\nChi-Yang Hsu, Yun-Wei Chu, Ting-Hao ‘Kenneth’ Huang, Lun-Wei Ku\nFindings 2021\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Writing a coherent and engaging story is not easy. Creative writers use their knowledge and worldview to put disjointed elements together to form a coherent storyline, and work and rework iteratively toward perfection. Automated visual storytelling (VIST) models, however, make poor use of external knowledge and iterative generation when attempting to create stories. This paper introduces PR-VIST, a framework that represents the input image sequence as a story graph in which it finds the best path to form a storyline. PR-VIST then takes this path and learns to generate the final story via an iterative training process. This framework produces stories that are superior in terms of diversity, coherence, and humanness, per both automatic and human evaluations. An ablation study shows that both plotting and reworking contribute to the model&#039;s superiority.\n\n\n\nThe Impact of Preference Agreement in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: A Case Study in Summarization\nSian Gooding, Hassan Mansoor\narXiv.org 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can be used to capture complex and nuanced properties of text generation quality. As a result, the task of text summarization has been identified as a good candidate for this process. In this paper, we explore how preference agreement impacts the efficacy of RLHF for summarization. We show that sampling human preferences to include a range of annotator agreement results in (1) higher accuracy reward models and (2) alters the characteristics of quality captured. We additionally show improvements in downstream generation when using a reward model trained with a range of preference agreements. Our contributions have implications for the design of synthetic datasets as well as the importance of considering quality differentials in comparison-based data.\n\n\n\nConfidence-aware Reward Optimization for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Models\nKyuyoung Kim, Jongheon Jeong, Minyong An, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, K. Dvijotham, Jinwoo Shin, Kimin Lee\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Fine-tuning text-to-image models with reward functions trained on human feedback data has proven effective for aligning model behavior with human intent. However, excessive optimization with such reward models, which serve as mere proxy objectives, can compromise the performance of fine-tuned models, a phenomenon known as reward overoptimization. To investigate this issue in depth, we introduce the Text-Image Alignment Assessment (TIA2) benchmark, which comprises a diverse collection of text prompts, images, and human annotations. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art reward models on this benchmark reveals their frequent misalignment with human assessment. We empirically demonstrate that overoptimization occurs notably when a poorly aligned reward model is used as the fine-tuning objective. To address this, we propose TextNorm, a simple method that enhances alignment based on a measure of reward model confidence estimated across a set of semantically contrastive text prompts. We demonstrate that incorporating the confidence-calibrated rewards in fine-tuning effectively reduces overoptimization, resulting in twice as many wins in human evaluation for text-image alignment compared against the baseline reward models.\n\n\n\nA Survey on Human Preference Learning for Large Language Models\nRuili Jiang, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Zhixuan He, Juntao Li, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Liqiang Nie, Min Zhang\narXiv.org 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   The recent surge of versatile large language models (LLMs) largely depends on aligning increasingly capable foundation models with human intentions by preference learning, enhancing LLMs with excellent applicability and effectiveness in a wide range of contexts. Despite the numerous related studies conducted, a perspective on how human preferences are introduced into LLMs remains limited, which may prevent a deeper comprehension of the relationships between human preferences and LLMs as well as the realization of their limitations. In this survey, we review the progress in exploring human preference learning for LLMs from a preference-centered perspective, covering the sources and formats of preference feedback, the modeling and usage of preference signals, as well as the evaluation of the aligned LLMs. We first categorize the human feedback according to data sources and formats. We then summarize techniques for human preferences modeling and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different schools of models. Moreover, we present various preference usage methods sorted by the objectives to utilize human preference signals. Finally, we summarize some prevailing approaches to evaluate LLMs in terms of alignment with human intentions and discuss our outlooks on the human intention alignment for LLMs.\n\n\n\nMAP: Multi-Human-Value Alignment Palette\nXinran Wang, Qi Le, Ammar Ahmed, Enmao Diao, Yi Zhou, Nathalie Baracaldo, Jie Ding, Ali Anwar\narXiv.org 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Ensuring that generative AI systems align with human values is essential but challenging, especially when considering multiple human values and their potential trade-offs. Since human values can be personalized and dynamically change over time, the desirable levels of value alignment vary across different ethnic groups, industry sectors, and user cohorts. Within existing frameworks, it is hard to define human values and align AI systems accordingly across different directions simultaneously, such as harmlessness, helpfulness, and positiveness. To address this, we develop a novel, first-principle approach called Multi-Human-Value Alignment Palette (MAP), which navigates the alignment across multiple human values in a structured and reliable way. MAP formulates the alignment problem as an optimization task with user-defined constraints, which define human value targets. It can be efficiently solved via a primal-dual approach, which determines whether a user-defined alignment target is achievable and how to achieve it. We conduct a detailed theoretical analysis of MAP by quantifying the trade-offs between values, the sensitivity to constraints, the fundamental connection between multi-value alignment and sequential alignment, and proving that linear weighted rewards are sufficient for multi-value alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate MAP&#039;s ability to align multiple values in a principled manner while delivering strong empirical performance across various tasks.\n\n\n\nFine-tuning of diffusion models via stochastic control: entropy regularization and beyond\nWenpin Tang\narXiv.org 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   This paper aims to develop and provide a rigorous treatment to the problem of entropy regularized fine-tuning in the context of continuous-time diffusion models, which was recently proposed by Uehara et al. (arXiv:2402.15194, 2024). The idea is to use stochastic control for sample generation, where the entropy regularizer is introduced to mitigate reward collapse. We also show how the analysis can be extended to fine-tuning involving a general $f$-divergence regularizer.\n\n\n\nCOS(M+O)S: Curiosity and RL-Enhanced MCTS for Exploring Story Space via Language Models\nTobias Materzok\narXiv.org 2025\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   We present COS(M+O)S, a System 2-inspired framework for open-ended plot development that systematically explores the vast space of possible story expansions, enabling a 3B-parameter language model to approach the plot quality of a 70B model on select short-story tasks. The method accomplishes this by combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), guided by a step-level value model that rewards moderate surprisal (curiosity) while penalizing incoherence, and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to fine-tune the policy on high-value plot expansions. This iterative reinforcement learning loop systematically explores multiple candidate plot branches, backpropagates quality signals, and adapts the policy for faster convergence, notably shifting the policy from puzzle-based Chain-of-Thought to more character-driven storytelling. In small-scale tests with short-story prompts, 67%-77% of participants favored COS(M+O)S&#039;s highest-rated expansions over lower-rated ones, suggesting that our learned value function aligns. GPT-4o ratings further show that COS(M+O)S surpasses naive single-pass decoding from Llama 3.2 3B by 0.59 SD, coming within 0.06 SD of Llama 3.1 70B (no significant difference, p=0.93). Pairwise comparisons with o1 place COS(M+O)S 1.5 SD above the 3B baseline and find no statistically significant gap from 70B. Nevertheless, absolute story quality remains modest, constrained by the small model&#039;s capacity and limited training data.\n\n\n\nCurriculum Direct Preference Optimization for Diffusion and Consistency Models\nNiculae Sebe, Florinel-Alin Croitoru, Radu Tudor Ionescu, Vlad Hondru, Mubarak Shah\narXiv.org 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on three benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference. Our code is available at anonymous.4open.science/r/Curriculum-DPO-EE14.\n\n\n\nThinking Outside the (Gray) Box: A Context-Based Score for Assessing Value and Originality in Neural Text Generation\nGiorgio Franceschelli, Mirco Musolesi\narXiv.org 2025\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Despite the increasing use of large language models for creative tasks, their outputs often lack diversity. Common solutions, such as sampling at higher temperatures, can compromise the quality of the results. Drawing on information theory, we propose a context-based score to quantitatively evaluate value and originality. This score incentivizes accuracy and adherence to the request while fostering divergence from the learned distribution. We propose using our score as a reward in a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune large language models for maximum performance. We validate our strategy through experiments in poetry generation and math problem solving, demonstrating that it enhances the value and originality of the generated solutions.\n\n\n\nShapley Values-Powered Framework for Fair Reward Split in Content Produced by GenAI\nAlex Glinsky, Alexey Sokolsky\narXiv.org 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   It is evident that, currently, generative models are surpassed in quality by human professionals. However, with the advancements in Artificial Intelligence, this gap will narrow, leading to scenarios where individuals who have dedicated years of their lives to mastering a skill become obsolete due to their high costs, which are inherently linked to the time they require to complete a task -- a task that AI could accomplish in minutes or seconds. To avoid future social upheavals, we must, even now, contemplate how to fairly assess the contributions of such individuals in training generative models and how to compensate them for the reduction or complete loss of their incomes. In this work, we propose a method to structure collaboration between model developers and data providers. To achieve this, we employ Shapley Values to quantify the contribution of artist(s) in an image generated by the Stable Diffusion-v1.5 model and to equitably allocate the reward among them.\n\n\n\nWhat Makes A Good Story? Designing Composite Rewards for Visual Storytelling\nJunjie Hu, Yu Cheng, Zhe Gan, Jingjing Liu, Jianfeng Gao, Graham Neubig\nAAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2019\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Previous storytelling approaches mostly focused on optimizing traditional metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE and CIDEr. In this paper, we re-examine this problem from a different angle, by looking deep into what defines a natural and topically-coherent story. To this end, we propose three assessment criteria: relevance, coherence and expressiveness, which we observe through empirical analysis could constitute a &quot;high-quality&quot; story to the human eye. We further propose a reinforcement learning framework, ReCo-RL, with reward functions designed to capture the essence of these quality criteria. Experiments on the Visual Storytelling Dataset (VIST) with both automatic and human evaluation demonstrate that our ReCo-RL model achieves better performance than state-of-the-art baselines on both traditional metrics and the proposed new criteria.\n\n\n\nControlNet++: Improving Conditional Controls with Efficient Consistency Feedback\nMing Li, Taojiannan Yang, Huafeng Kuang, Jie Wu, Zhaoning Wang, Xuefeng Xiao, Chen Chen\nEuropean Conference on Computer Vision 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, existing efforts like ControlNet incorporated image-based conditional controls. In this paper, we reveal that existing methods still face significant challenges in generating images that align with the image conditional controls. To this end, we propose ControlNet++, a novel approach that improves controllable generation by explicitly optimizing pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images and conditional controls. Specifically, for an input conditional control, we use a pre-trained discriminative reward model to extract the corresponding condition of the generated images, and then optimize the consistency loss between the input conditional control and extracted condition. A straightforward implementation would be generating images from random noises and then calculating the consistency loss, but such an approach requires storing gradients for multiple sampling timesteps, leading to considerable time and memory costs. To address this, we introduce an efficient reward strategy that deliberately disturbs the input images by adding noise, and then uses the single-step denoised images for reward fine-tuning. This avoids the extensive costs associated with image sampling, allowing for more efficient reward fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that ControlNet++ significantly improves controllability under various conditional controls. For example, it achieves improvements over ControlNet by 11.1% mIoU, 13.4% SSIM, and 7.6% RMSE, respectively, for segmentation mask, line-art edge, and depth conditions. All the code, models, demo and organized data have been open sourced on our Github Repo.\n\n\n\nOn the evaluation of generative models in music\nLi-Chia Yang, Alexander Lerch\nNeural computing &amp; applications (Print) 2018\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n\n\n\nDeep reinforcement learning for de novo drug design\nAlexander Tropsha, Olexandr Isayev, Mariya Popova\nScience Advances 2017\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   We introduce an artificial intelligence approach to de novo design of molecules with desired physical or biological properties. We have devised and implemented a novel computational strategy for de novo design of molecules with desired properties termed ReLeaSE (Reinforcement Learning for Structural Evolution). On the basis of deep and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, ReLeaSE integrates two deep neural networks-generative and predictive-that are trained separately but are used jointly to generate novel targeted chemical libraries. ReLeaSE uses simple representation of molecules by their simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings only. Generative models are trained with a stack-augmented memory network to produce chemically feasible SMILES strings, and predictive models are derived to forecast the desired properties of the de novo-generated compounds. In the first phase of the method, generative and predictive models are trained separately with a supervised learning algorithm. In the second phase, both models are trained jointly with the RL approach to bias the generation of new chemical structures toward those with the desired physical and/or biological properties. In the proof-of-concept study, we have used the ReLeaSE method to design chemical libraries with a bias toward structural complexity or toward compounds with maximal, minimal, or specific range of physical properties, such as melting point or hydrophobicity, or toward compounds with inhibitory activity against Janus protein kinase 2. The approach proposed herein can find a general use for generating targeted chemical libraries of novel compounds optimized for either a single desired property or multiple properties.\n\n\n\nQuantitative Characteristics of Human-Written Short Stories as a Metric for Automated Storytelling\nC. León, Pablo Gervás, Pablo Delatorre, Alan Tapscott\nNew generation computing 2020\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Evaluating the extent to which computer-produced stories are structured like human-invented narratives can be an important component of the quality of a story plot. In this paper, we report on an empirical experiment in which human subjects have invented short plots in a constrained scenario. The stories were annotated according to features commonly found in existing automatic story generators. The annotation was designed to measure the proportion and relations of story components that should be used in automatic computational systems for matching human behaviour. Results suggest that there are relatively common patterns that can be used as input data for identifying similarity to human-invented stories in automatic storytelling systems. The found patterns are in line with narratological models, and the results provide numerical quantification and layout of story components. The proposed method of story analysis is tested over two additional sources, the ROCStories corpus and stories generated by automated storytellers, to illustrate the valuable insights that may be derived from them.\n\n\n\nReinforcement Learning for Generative AI: State of the Art, Opportunities and Open Research Challenges\nGiorgio Franceschelli, Mirco Musolesi\nJournal of Artificial Intelligence Research 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting developments in Computer Science of the last decade. At the same time, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a very successful paradigm for a variety of machine learning tasks. In this survey, we discuss the state of the art, opportunities and open research questions in applying RL to generative AI. In particular, we will discuss three types of applications, namely, RL as an alternative way for generation without specified objectives; as a way for generating outputs while concurrently maximizing an objective function; and, finally, as a way of embedding desired characteristics, which cannot be easily captured by means of an objective function, into the generative process. We conclude the survey with an in-depth discussion of the opportunities and challenges in this fascinating emerging area.\n\n\n\nCopyright-Aware Incentive Scheme for Generative Art Models Using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning\nLingjuan Lyu, Zhuan Shi, Yifei Song, Xiaoli Tang, Boi Faltings\narXiv.org 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Generative art using Diffusion models has achieved remarkable performance in image generation and text-to-image tasks. However, the increasing demand for training data in generative art raises significant concerns about copyright infringement, as models can produce images highly similar to copyrighted works. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this by perturbing Diffusion models to reduce the likelihood of generating such images, but this often compromises model performance. Another approach focuses on economically compensating data holders for their contributions, yet it fails to address copyright loss adequately. Our approach begin with the introduction of a novel copyright metric grounded in copyright law and court precedents on infringement. We then employ the TRAK method to estimate the contribution of data holders. To accommodate the continuous data collection process, we divide the training into multiple rounds. Finally, We designed a hierarchical budget allocation method based on reinforcement learning to determine the budget for each round and the remuneration of the data holder based on the data holder&#039;s contribution and copyright loss in each round. Extensive experiments across three datasets show that our method outperforms all eight benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing budget distribution in a copyright-aware manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first technical work that introduces to incentive contributors and protect their copyrights by compensating them.\n\n\n\nShaping Rewards for Reinforcement Learning with Imperfect Demonstrations using Generative Models\nYuchen Wu, Melissa Mozifian, F. Shkurti\nIEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2020\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   The potential benefits of model-free reinforcement learning to real robotics systems are limited by its uninformed exploration that leads to slow convergence, lack of data-efficiency, and unnecessary interactions with the environment. To address these drawbacks we propose a method that combines reinforcement and imitation learning by shaping the reward function with a state-and-action-dependent potential that is trained from demonstration data, using a generative model. We show that this accelerates policy learning by specifying high-value areas of the state and action space that are worth exploring first. Unlike the majority of existing methods that assume optimal demonstrations and incorporate the demonstration data as hard constraints on policy optimization, we instead incorporate demonstration data as advice in the form of a reward shaping potential trained as a generative model of states and actions. In particular, we examine both normalizing flows and Generative Adversarial Networks to represent these potentials. We show that, unlike many existing approaches that incorporate demonstrations as hard constraints, our approach is unbiased even in the case of suboptimal and noisy demonstrations. We present an extensive range of simulations, as well as experiments on the Franka Emika 7DOF arm, to demonstrate the practicality of our method.\n\n\n\nFantastic Rewards and How to Tame Them: A Case Study on Reward Learning for Task-oriented Dialogue Systems\nCaiming Xiong, Shentao Yang, Shujian Zhang, Haiquan Wang, Mi Zhou, Yihao Feng, Jianguo Zhang\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   When learning task-oriented dialogue (ToD) agents, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can naturally be utilized to train dialogue strategies to achieve user-specific goals. Prior works mainly focus on adopting advanced RL techniques to train the ToD agents, while the design of the reward function is not well studied. This paper aims at answering the question of how to efficiently learn and leverage a reward function for training end-to-end (E2E) ToD agents. Specifically, we introduce two generalized objectives for reward-function learning, inspired by the classical learning-to-rank literature. Further, we utilize the learned reward function to guide the training of the E2E ToD agent. With the proposed techniques, we achieve competitive results on the E2E response-generation task on the Multiwoz 2.0 dataset.

Xing, Zhengzhong Liu\nConference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing 2021\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is the predominant algorithm for training text generation models. This paradigm relies on direct supervision examples, which is not applicable to many emerging applications, such as generating adversarial attacks or generating prompts to control language models. Reinforcement learning (RL) on the other hand offers a more flexible solution by allowing users to plug in arbitrary task metrics as reward. Yet previous RL algorithms for text generation, such as policy gradient (on-policy RL) and Q-learning (off-policy RL), are often notoriously inefficient or unstable to train due to the large sequence space and the sparse reward received only at the end of sequences. In this paper, we introduce a new RL formulation for text generation from the soft Q-learning (SQL) perspective. It enables us to draw from the latest RL advances, such as path consistency learning, to combine the best of on-/off-policy updates, and learn effectively from sparse reward. We apply the approach to a wide range of novel text generation tasks, including learning from noisy/negative examples, adversarial attacks, and prompt generation. Experiments show our approach consistently outperforms both task-specialized algorithms and the previous RL methods.\n\n\n\nDeep Reward Supervisions for Tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models\nXiaoshi Wu, Yiming Hao, Manyuan Zhang, Keqiang Sun, Zhaoyang Huang, Guanglu Song, Yu Liu, Hongsheng Li\nEuropean Conference on Computer Vision 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Optimizing a text-to-image diffusion model with a given reward function is an important but underexplored research area. In this study, we propose Deep Reward Tuning (DRTune), an algorithm that directly supervises the final output image of a text-to-image diffusion model and back-propagates through the iterative sampling process to the input noise. We find that training earlier steps in the sampling process is crucial for low-level rewards, and deep supervision can be achieved efficiently and effectively by stopping the gradient of the denoising network input. DRTune is extensively evaluated on various reward models. It consistently outperforms other algorithms, particularly for low-level control signals, where all shallow supervision methods fail. Additionally, we fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 (SDXL 1.0) model via DRTune to optimize Human Preference Score v2.1, resulting in the Favorable Diffusion XL 1.0 (FDXL 1.0) model. FDXL 1.0 significantly enhances image quality compared to SDXL 1.0 and reaches comparable quality compared with Midjourney v5.2.\n\n\n\nEnergy-Based Models for Code Generation under Compilability Constraints\nTomasz Korbak, Hady ElSahar, Marc Dymetman, Germán Kruszewski\narXiv.org 2021\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Neural language models can be successfully trained on source code, leading to applications such as code completion. However, their versatile autoregressive self-supervision objective overlooks important global sequence-level features that are present in the data such as syntactic correctness or compilability. In this work, we pose the problem of learning to generate compilable code as constraint satisfaction. We define an Energy-Based Model (EBM) representing a pre-trained generative model with an imposed constraint of generating only compilable sequences. We then use the KL-Adaptive Distributional Policy Gradient algorithm (Khalifa et al., 2021) to train a generative model approximating the EBM. We conduct experiments showing that our proposed approach is able to improve compilability rates without sacrificing diversity and complexity of the generated samples.\n\n\n\nPredicting the Quality of Short Narratives from Social Media\nTong Wang, Ping Chen, Boyang Albert Li\nInternational Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2017\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   An important and difficult challenge in building computational models for narratives is the automatic evaluation of narrative quality. Quality evaluation connects narrative understanding and generation as generation systems need to evaluate their own products. To circumvent difficulties in acquiring annotations, we employ upvotes in social media as an approximate measure for story quality. We collected 54,484 answers from a crowd-powered question-and-answer website, Quora, and then used active learning to build a classifier that labeled 28,320 answers as stories. To predict the number of upvotes without the use of social network features, we create neural networks that model textual regions and the interdependence among regions, which serve as strong benchmarks for future research. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale study for automatic evaluation of narrative quality.\n\n\n\nChoose Your Own Adventure: Paired Suggestions in Collaborative Writing for Evaluating Story Generation Models\nElizabeth Clark, Noah A. Smith\nNorth American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics 2021\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Story generation is an open-ended and subjective task, which poses a challenge for evaluating story generation models. We present Choose Your Own Adventure, a collaborative writing setup for pairwise model evaluation. Two models generate suggestions to people as they write a short story; we ask writers to choose one of the two suggestions, and we observe which model’s suggestions they prefer. The setup also allows further analysis based on the revisions people make to the suggestions. We show that these measures, combined with automatic metrics, provide an informative picture of the models’ performance, both in cases where the differences in generation methods are small (nucleus vs. top-k sampling) and large (GPT2 vs. Fusion models).\n\n\n\nThe Next Chapter: A Study of Large Language Models in Storytelling\nZhuohan Xie, Trevor Cohn, Jey Han Lau\nInternational Conference on Natural Language Generation 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   To enhance the quality of generated stories, recent story generation models have been investigating the utilization of higher-level attributes like plots or commonsense knowledge. The application of prompt-based learning with large language models (LLMs), exemplified by GPT-3, has exhibited remarkable performance in diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This paper conducts a comprehensive investigation, utilizing both automatic and human evaluation, to compare the story generation capacity of LLMs with recent models across three datasets with variations in style, register, and length of stories. The results demonstrate that LLMs generate stories of significantly higher quality compared to other story generation models. Moreover, they exhibit a level of performance that competes with human authors, albeit with the preliminary observation that they tend to replicate real stories in situations involving world knowledge, resembling a form of plagiarism.\n\n\n\nSkywork-Reward: Bag of Tricks for Reward Modeling in LLMs\nChris Liu, Liang Zeng, Jiacai Liu, Rui Yan, Jujie He, Chaojie Wang, Shuicheng Yan, Yang Liu, Yahui Zhou\narXiv.org 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   In this report, we introduce a collection of methods to enhance reward modeling for LLMs, focusing specifically on data-centric techniques. We propose effective data selection and filtering strategies for curating high-quality open-source preference datasets, culminating in the Skywork-Reward data collection, which contains only 80K preference pairs -- significantly smaller than existing datasets. Using this curated dataset, we developed the Skywork-Reward model series -- Skywork-Reward-Gemma-27B and Skywork-Reward-Llama-3.1-8B -- with the former currently holding the top position on the RewardBench leaderboard. Notably, our techniques and datasets have directly enhanced the performance of many top-ranked models on RewardBench, highlighting the practical impact of our contributions in real-world preference learning applications.\n\n\n\nDiversity-Rewarded CFG Distillation\nGeoffrey Cideron, Andrea Agostinelli, Johan Ferret, Sertan Girgin, R. Élie, Olivier Bachem, Sarah Perrin, Alexandre Ram’e\narXiv.org 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Generative models are transforming creative domains such as music generation, with inference-time strategies like Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) playing a crucial role. However, CFG doubles inference cost while limiting originality and diversity across generated contents. In this paper, we introduce diversity-rewarded CFG distillation, a novel finetuning procedure that distills the strengths of CFG while addressing its limitations. Our approach optimises two training objectives: (1) a distillation objective, encouraging the model alone (without CFG) to imitate the CFG-augmented predictions, and (2) an RL objective with a diversity reward, promoting the generation of diverse outputs for a given prompt. By finetuning, we learn model weights with the ability to generate high-quality and diverse outputs, without any inference overhead. This also unlocks the potential of weight-based model merging strategies: by interpolating between the weights of two models (the first focusing on quality, the second on diversity), we can control the quality-diversity trade-off at deployment time, and even further boost performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the MusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023) text-to-music generative model, where our approach surpasses CFG in terms of quality-diversity Pareto optimality. According to human evaluators, our finetuned-then-merged model generates samples with higher quality-diversity than the base model augmented with CFG.

Stein, Jesse C. Cresswell, Rasa Hosseinzadeh, Yi Sui, Brendan Leigh Ross, Valentin Villecroze, Zhaoyan Liu, Anthony L. Caterini, J. E. T. Taylor, G. Loaiza-Ganem\nNeural Information Processing Systems 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   We systematically study a wide variety of generative models spanning semantically-diverse image datasets to understand and improve the feature extractors and metrics used to evaluate them. Using best practices in psychophysics, we measure human perception of image realism for generated samples by conducting the largest experiment evaluating generative models to date, and find that no existing metric strongly correlates with human evaluations. Comparing to 17 modern metrics for evaluating the overall performance, fidelity, diversity, rarity, and memorization of generative models, we find that the state-of-the-art perceptual realism of diffusion models as judged by humans is not reflected in commonly reported metrics such as FID. This discrepancy is not explained by diversity in generated samples, though one cause is over-reliance on Inception-V3. We address these flaws through a study of alternative self-supervised feature extractors, find that the semantic information encoded by individual networks strongly depends on their training procedure, and show that DINOv2-ViT-L/14 allows for much richer evaluation of generative models. Next, we investigate data memorization, and find that generative models do memorize training examples on simple, smaller datasets like CIFAR10, but not necessarily on more complex datasets like ImageNet. However, our experiments show that current metrics do not properly detect memorization: none in the literature is able to separate memorization from other phenomena such as underfitting or mode shrinkage. To facilitate further development of generative models and their evaluation we release all generated image datasets, human evaluation data, and a modular library to compute 17 common metrics for 9 different encoders at github.com/layer6ai-labs/dgm-eval.\n\n\n\nHow interesting and coherent are the stories generated by a large‐scale neural language model? Comparing human and automatic evaluations of machine‐generated text\nDominic Callan, Jennifer Foster\nExpert Syst. J. Knowl. Eng. 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Evaluation of the narrative text generated by machines has traditionally been a challenge, particularly when attempting to evaluate subjective elements such as interest or believability. Recent improvements in narrative machine text generation have been largely driven by the emergence of transformer‐based language models, trained on massive quantities of data, resulting in higher quality text generation. In this study, a corpus of stories is generated using the pre‐trained GPT‐Neo transformer model, with human‐written prompts as inputs upon which to base the narrative text. The stories generated through this process are subsequently evaluated through both human evaluation and two automated metrics: BERTScore and BERT Next Sentence Prediction, with the aim of determining whether there is a correlation between the automatic scores and the human judgements. The results show variation in human evaluation results in comparison to modern automated metrics, suggesting further work is required to train automated metrics to identify text that is defined as interesting by humans.\n\n\n\nSTORIUM: A Dataset and Evaluation Platform for Machine-in-the-Loop Story Generation\nNader Akoury, Shufan Wang, Josh Whiting, Stephen Hood, Nanyun Peng, Mohit Iyyer\nConference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing 2020\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Systems for story generation are asked to produce plausible and enjoyable stories given an input context. This task is underspecified, as a vast number of diverse stories can originate from a single input. The large output space makes it difficult to build and evaluate story generation models, as (1) existing datasets lack rich enough contexts to meaningfully guide models, and (2) existing evaluations (both crowdsourced and automatic) are unreliable for assessing long-form creative text. To address these issues, we introduce a dataset and evaluation platform built from STORIUM, an online collaborative storytelling community. Our author-generated dataset contains 6K lengthy stories (125M tokens) with fine-grained natural language annotations (e.g., character goals and attributes) interspersed throughout each narrative, forming a robust source for guiding models. We evaluate language models fine-tuned on our dataset by integrating them onto STORIUM, where real authors can query a model for suggested story continuations and then edit them. Automatic metrics computed over these edits correlate well with both user ratings of generated stories and qualitative feedback from semi-structured user interviews. We release both the STORIUM dataset and evaluation platform to spur more principled research into story generation.\n\n\n\nDecoding Methods for Neural Narrative Generation\nAlexandra DeLucia, Aaron Mueller, Xiang Lisa Li, João Sedoc\nIEEE Games Entertainment Media Conference 2020\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Narrative generation is an open-ended NLP task in which a model generates a story given a prompt. The task is similar to neural response generation for chatbots; however, innovations in response generation are often not applied to narrative generation, despite the similarity between these tasks. We aim to bridge this gap by applying and evaluating advances in decoding methods for neural response generation to neural narrative generation. In particular, we employ GPT-2 and perform ablations across nucleus sampling thresholds and diverse decoding hyperparameters-specifically, maximum mutual information-analyzing results over multiple criteria with automatic and human evaluation. We find that (1) nucleus sampling is generally best with thresholds between 0.7 and 0.9; (2) a maximum mutual information objective can improve the quality of generated stories; and (3) established automatic metrics do not correlate well with human judgments of narrative quality on any qualitative metric.\n\n\n\nObjective Evaluation Metric for Motion Generative Models: Validating Fréchet Motion Distance on Foot Skating and Over-smoothing Artifacts.\nAntoine Maiorca, Hugo Bohy, Youngwoo Yoon, Thierry Dutoit\nMotion in Games 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Nowadays, Deep Learning-powered generative models are able to generate new synthetic samples nearly indistinguishable from natural data. The development of such systems necessarily involves the design of evaluation protocols to assess their performance. Quantitative objective metrics, such as Fréchet distance, in addition to human-centered subjective surveys, have become a standard for evaluating generative algorithms. Although motion generation is a popular research field, only a few works addressed the problem of the design and validation of a robust objective evaluation metric for motion-generative models. These previous works proposed to degrade ground truth motion samples with synthetic noises (e.g., Gaussian, Salt&amp; Pepper) and studied the behavior of the proposed metric. However, this degradation does not mimic common motion artifacts produced by generative models. In this work, we propose (1) to validate Fréchet distance-based objective metrics on motion datasets degraded by two realistic motion artifacts, foot skating and over-smoothing, often found in motion synthesis results, and (2) a Fréchet Motion Distance (FMD), using Transformer-based feature extractor, able to capture the motion artifacts and also robust towards the variation of motion length.\n\n\n\nModifying Large Language Model Post-Training for Diverse Creative Writing\nJohn Joon Young Chung, Vishakh Padmakumar, Melissa Roemmele, Yuqian Sun, Max Kreminski\narXiv.org 2025\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   As creative writing tasks do not have singular correct answers, large language models (LLMs) trained to perform these tasks should be able to generate diverse valid outputs. However, LLM post-training often focuses on improving generation quality but neglects to facilitate output diversity. Hence, in creative writing generation, we investigate post-training approaches to promote both output diversity and quality. Our core idea is to include deviation -- the degree of difference between a training sample and all other samples with the same prompt -- in the training objective to facilitate learning from rare high-quality instances. By adopting our approach to direct preference optimization (DPO) and odds ratio preference optimization (ORPO), we demonstrate that we can promote the output diversity of trained models while minimally decreasing quality. Our best model with 8B parameters could achieve on-par diversity as a human-created dataset while having output quality similar to the best instruction-tuned models we examined, GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1. We further validate our approaches with a human evaluation, an ablation, and a comparison to an existing diversification approach, DivPO.\n\n\n\nLearning to Reason for Long-Form Story Generation\nAlexander Gurung, Mirella Lapata\narXiv.org 2025\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Generating high-quality stories spanning thousands of tokens requires competency across a variety of skills, from tracking plot and character arcs to keeping a consistent and engaging style. Due to the difficulty of sourcing labeled datasets and precise quality measurements, most work using large language models (LLMs) for long-form story generation uses combinations of hand-designed prompting techniques to elicit author-like behavior. This is a manual process that is highly dependent on the specific story-generation task. Motivated by the recent success of applying RL with Verifiable Rewards to domains like math and coding, we propose a general story-generation task (Next-Chapter Prediction) and a reward formulation (Verified Rewards via Completion Likelihood Improvement) that allows us to use an unlabeled book dataset as a learning signal for reasoning. We learn to reason over a story&#039;s condensed information and generate a detailed plan for the next chapter. Our reasoning is evaluated via the chapters it helps a story-generator create, and compared against non-trained and supervised finetuning (SFT) baselines. Pairwise human judgments reveal the chapters our learned reasoning produces are preferred across almost all metrics, and the effect is more pronounced in Scifi and Fantasy genres.\n\n\n\nCreativity in AI: Progresses and Challenges\nLonneke van der Plas, Antoine Bosselut, Debjit Paul, Mete Ismayilzada\narXiv.org 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Creativity is the ability to produce novel, useful, and surprising ideas, and has been widely studied as a crucial aspect of human cognition. Machine creativity on the other hand has been a long-standing challenge. With the rise of advanced generative AI, there has been renewed interest and debate regarding AI&#039;s creative capabilities. Therefore, it is imperative to revisit the state of creativity in AI and identify key progresses and remaining challenges. In this work, we survey leading works studying the creative capabilities of AI systems, focusing on creative problem-solving, linguistic, artistic, and scientific creativity. Our review suggests that while the latest AI models are largely capable of producing linguistically and artistically creative outputs such as poems, images, and musical pieces, they struggle with tasks that require creative problem-solving, abstract thinking and compositionality and their generations suffer from a lack of diversity, originality, long-range incoherence and hallucinations. We also discuss key questions concerning copyright and authorship issues with generative models. Furthermore, we highlight the need for a comprehensive evaluation of creativity that is process-driven and considers several dimensions of creativity. Finally, we propose future research directions to improve the creativity of AI outputs, drawing inspiration from cognitive science and psychology.\n\n\n\nToward Interactive Music Generation: A Position Paper\nS. Dadman, B. Bremdal, B. Bang, Rune Dalmo\nIEEE Access 2022\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Music generation using deep learning has received considerable attention in recent years. Researchers have developed various generative models capable of imitating musical conventions, comprehending the musical corpora, and generating new samples based on the learning outcome. Although the samples generated by these models are persuasive, they often lack musical structure and creativity. For instance, a vanilla end-to-end approach, which deals with all levels of music representation at once, does not offer human-level control and interaction during the learning process, leading to constrained results. Indeed, music creation is a recurrent process that follows some principles by a musician, where various musical features are reused or adapted. On the other hand, a musical piece adheres to a musical style, breaking down into precise concepts of timbre style, performance style, composition style, and the coherency between these aspects. Here, we study and analyze the current advances in music generation using deep learning models through different criteria. We discuss the shortcomings and limitations of these models regarding interactivity and adaptability. Finally, we draw the potential future research direction addressing multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning algorithms to alleviate these shortcomings and limitations.\n\n\n\nChallenges in creative generative models for music: a divergence maximization perspective\nAxel Chemla-Romeu-Santos, P. Esling\narXiv.org 2022\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   The development of generative Machine Learning (ML) models in creative prac-tices, enabled by the recent improvements in usability and availability of pre-trained models, is raising more and more interest among artists, practitioners and perform-ers. Yet, the introduction of such techniques in artistic domains also revealed multiple limitations that escape current evaluation methods used by scientists. Notably, most models are still unable to generate content that lay outside of the domain deﬁned by the training dataset. In this paper, we propose an alternative prospective framework, starting from a new general formulation of ML objectives, that we derive to delineate possible implications and solutions that already exist in the ML literature (notably for the audio and musical domain). We also discuss existing relations between generative models and computational creativity and how our framework could help address the lack of creativity in existing models.\n\n\n\nConditional End-to-End Audio Transforms\nAlbert Haque, Michelle Guo, Prateek Verma\nInterspeech 2018\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   We present an end-to-end method for transforming audio from one style to another. For the case of speech, by conditioning on speaker identities, we can train a single model to transform words spoken by multiple people into multiple target voices. For the case of music, we can specify musical instruments and achieve the same result. Architecturally, our method is a fully-differentiable sequence-to-sequence model based on convolutional and hierarchical recurrent neural networks. It is designed to capture long-term acoustic dependencies, requires minimal post-processing, and produces realistic audio transforms. Ablation studies confirm that our model can separate speaker and instrument properties from acoustic content at different receptive fields. Empirically, our method achieves competitive performance on community-standard datasets.\n\n\n\nPerception Score: A Learned Metric for Open-ended Text Generation Evaluation\nJing Gu, Qingyang Wu, Zhou Yu\nAAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2021\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Automatic evaluation for open-ended natural language generation tasks remains a challenge. We propose a learned evaluation metric: Perception Score. It utilizes a pre-trained model and considers context information for conditional generation. Perception Score assigns a holistic score along with the uncertainty measurement. We conduct experiments on three open-ended conditional generation tasks and two open-ended unconditional generation tasks. Perception Score achieves state-of-the-art results on all the tasks consistently in terms of correlation with human evaluation scores.\n\n\n\nDeltaScore: Fine-Grained Story Evaluation with Perturbations\nZhuohan Xie, Miao Li, Trevor Cohn, Jey Han Lau\nConference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Numerous evaluation metrics have been developed for natural language generation tasks, but their effectiveness in evaluating stories is limited as they are not specifically tailored to assess intricate aspects of storytelling, such as fluency and interestingness. In this paper, we introduce DELTASCORE, a novel methodology that employs perturbation techniques for the evaluation of nuanced story aspects. Our central proposition posits that the extent to which a story excels in a specific aspect (e.g., fluency) correlates with the magnitude of its susceptibility to particular perturbations (e.g., the introduction of typos). Given this, we measure the quality of an aspect by calculating the likelihood difference between pre- and post-perturbation states using pre-trained language models. We compare DELTASCORE with existing metrics on storytelling datasets from two domains in five fine-grained story aspects: fluency, coherence, relatedness, logicality, and interestingness. DELTASCORE demonstrates remarkable performance, revealing a surprising finding that a specific perturbation proves highly effective in capturing multiple aspects.\n\n\n\nCreative Writing with a Machine in the Loop: Case Studies on Slogans and Stories\nElizabeth Clark, A.

In particular, large language models (LLMs) can hardly produce written works at the level of human experts due to the extremely high complexity of literature writing. In this paper, we present HoLLMwood, an automated framework for unleashing the creativity of LLMs and exploring their potential in screenwriting, which is a highly demanding task. Mimicking the human creative process, we assign LLMs to different roles involved in the real-world scenario. In addition to the common practice of treating LLMs as ${Writer}$, we also apply LLMs as ${Editor}$, who is responsible for providing feedback and revision advice to ${Writer}$. Besides, to enrich the characters and deepen the plots, we introduce a role-playing mechanism and adopt LLMs as ${Actors}$ that can communicate and interact with each other. Evaluations on automatically generated screenplays show that HoLLMwood substantially outperforms strong baselines in terms of coherence, relevance, interestingness and overall quality.\n\n\n\nAI as a Sport: On the Competitive Epistemologies of Benchmarking\nWill Orr, Edward B. Kang\nConference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are evaluated using competitive methods that rely on benchmark datasets to determine performance. These benchmark datasets, however, are often constructed through arbitrary processes that fall short in encapsulating the depth and breadth of the tasks they are intended to measure. In this paper, we interrogate the naturalization of benchmark datasets as veracious metrics by examining the historical development of benchmarking as an epistemic practice in AI research. Specifically, we highlight three key case studies that were crucial in establishing the existing reliance on benchmark datasets for evaluating the capabilities of AI systems: (1) the sharing of Highleyman’s OCR dataset in the 1960s, which solidified a community of knowledge production around a shared benchmark dataset, (2) the Common Task Framework (CTF) of the 1980s, a state-led project to standardize benchmark datasets as legitimate indicators of technical progress; and (3) the Netflix Prize which further solidified benchmarking as a competitive goal within the ML research community. This genealogy highlights how contemporary dynamics and limitations of benchmarking developed from a longer history of collaboration, standardization, and competition. We end with reflections on how this history informs our understanding of benchmarking in the current era of generative artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nEvaluating Large Language Model Creativity from a Literary Perspective\nMurray Shanahan, Catherine Clarke\narXiv.org 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   This paper assesses the potential for large language models (LLMs) to serve as assistive tools in the creative writing process, by means of a single, in-depth case study. In the course of the study, we develop interactive and multi-voice prompting strategies that interleave background descriptions (scene setting, plot elements), instructions that guide composition, samples of text in the target style, and critical discussion of the given samples. We qualitatively evaluate the results from a literary critical perspective, as well as from the standpoint of computational creativity (a sub-field of artificial intelligence). Our findings lend support to the view that the sophistication of the results that can be achieved with an LLM mirrors the sophistication of the prompting.\n\n\n\nArt or Artifice? Large Language Models and the False Promise of Creativity\nTuhin Chakrabarty, Philippe Laban, Divyansh Agarwal, Chien-Sheng Wu, Smaranda Muresan\nInternational Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Researchers have argued that large language models (LLMs) exhibit high-quality writing capabilities from blogs to stories. However, evaluating objectively the creativity of a piece of writing is challenging. Inspired by the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) [64], which measures creativity as a process, we use the Consensual Assessment Technique [3] and propose Torrance Test of Creative Writing (TTCW) to evaluate creativity as product. TTCW consists of 14 binary tests organized into the original dimensions of Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. We recruit 10 creative writers and implement a human assessment of 48 stories written either by professional authors or LLMs using TTCW. Our analysis shows that LLM-generated stories pass 3-10X less TTCW tests than stories written by professionals. In addition, we explore the use of LLMs as assessors to automate the TTCW evaluation, revealing that none of the LLMs positively correlate with the expert assessments.\n\n\n\nThe Perils of Using Mechanical Turk to Evaluate Open-Ended Text Generation\nMarzena Karpinska, Nader Akoury, Mohit Iyyer\nConference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing 2021\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Recent text generation research has increasingly focused on open-ended domains such as story and poetry generation. Because models built for such tasks are difficult to evaluate automatically, most researchers in the space justify their modeling choices by collecting crowdsourced human judgments of text quality (e.g., Likert scores of coherence or grammaticality) from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). In this paper, we first conduct a survey of 45 open-ended text generation papers and find that the vast majority of them fail to report crucial details about their AMT tasks, hindering reproducibility. We then run a series of story evaluation experiments with both AMT workers and English teachers and discover that even with strict qualification filters, AMT workers (unlike teachers) fail to distinguish between model-generated text and human-generated references. We show that AMT worker judgments improve when they are shown model-generated output alongside human-generated references, which enables the workers to better calibrate their ratings. Finally, interviews with the English teachers provide deeper insights into the challenges of the evaluation process, particularly when rating model-generated text.\n\n\n\nFollow the Wisdom of the Crowd: Effective Text Generation via Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding\nMirac Suzgun, Luke Melas-Kyriazi, Dan Jurafsky\nAnnual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics 2022\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   In open-ended natural-language generation, existing text decoding methods typically struggle to produce text which is both diverse and high-quality. Greedy and beam search are known to suffer from text degeneration and linguistic diversity issues, while temperature, top-k, and nucleus sampling often yield diverse but low-quality outputs. In this work, we present crowd sampling, a family of decoding methods based on Bayesian risk minimization, to address this diversity-quality trade-off. Inspired by the principle of&quot;the wisdom of the crowd,&quot;crowd sampling seeks to select a candidate from a pool of candidates that has the least expected risk (i.e., highest expected reward) under a generative model according to a given utility function. Crowd sampling can be seen as a generalization of numerous existing methods, including majority voting, and in practice, it can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing sampling methods. Extensive experiments show that crowd sampling delivers improvements of 3-7 ROUGE and BLEU points across a wide range of tasks, including summarization, data-to-text, translation, and textual style transfer, while achieving new state-of-the-art results on WebNLG and WMT&#039;16.\n\n\n\nReproducible Subjective Evaluation\nMax Morrison, Brian Tang, Gefei Tan, Bryan Pardo\narXiv.org 2022\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Human perceptual studies are the gold standard for the evaluation of many research tasks in machine learning, linguistics, and psychology. However, these studies require significant time and cost to perform. As a result, many researchers use objective measures that can correlate poorly with human evaluation. When subjective evaluations are performed, they are often not reported with sufficient detail to ensure reproducibility. We propose Reproducible Subjective Evaluation (ReSEval), an open-source framework for quickly deploying crowdsourced subjective evaluations directly from Python. ReSEval lets researchers launch A/B, ABX, Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and MUltiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor (MUSHRA) tests on audio, image, text, or video data from a command-line interface or using one line of Python, making it as easy to run as objective evaluation. With ReSEval, researchers can reproduce each other&#039;s subjective evaluations by sharing a configuration file and the audio, image, text, or video files.\n\n\n\nNot (yet) the whole story: Evaluating Visual Storytelling Requires More than Measuring Coherence, Grounding, and Repetition\nSandro Pezzelle, Aditya K Surikuchi, Raquel Fern’andez\nConference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Visual storytelling consists in generating a natural language story given a temporally ordered sequence of images. This task is not only challenging for models, but also very difficult to evaluate with automatic metrics since there is no consensus about what makes a story &#039;good&#039;. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that measures story quality in terms of human likeness regarding three key aspects highlighted in previous work: visual grounding, coherence, and repetitiveness. We then use this method to evaluate the stories generated by several models, showing that the foundation model LLaVA obtains the best result, but only slightly so compared to TAPM, a 50-times smaller visual storytelling model. Upgrading the visual and language components of TAPM results in a model that yields competitive performance with a relatively low number of parameters. Finally, we carry out a human evaluation study, whose results suggest that a &#039;good&#039; story may require more than a human-like level of visual grounding, coherence, and repetition.\n\n\n\nOn the Problem of Small Objects\nTiasa Mondol, Daniel G. Brown\nEntropy 2021\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   We discuss how to assess computationally the aesthetic value of &quot;small&quot; objects, namely those that have short digital descriptions. Such small objects still matter: they include headlines, poems, song lyrics, short musical scripts and other culturally crucial items. Yet, small objects are a confounding case for our recent work adapting ideas from algorithmic information theory (AIT) to the domain of computational creativity, as they cannot be either logically deep or sophisticated following the traditional definitions of AIT. We show how restricting the class of models under analysis can make it the case that we can still separate high-quality small objects from ordinary ones, and discuss the strengths and limitations of our adaptation.\n\n\n\nCreative Help: A Story Writing Assistant\nMelissa Roemmele, A.

Weisz, Michael J. Muller, Steven I. Ross, Fernando Martinez, Stephanie Houde, Mayank Agarwal, Kartik Talamadupula, John T. Richards\nInternational Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces 2022\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Generative machine learning models have recently been applied to source code, for use cases including translating code between programming languages, creating documentation from code, and auto-completing methods. Yet, state-of-the-art models often produce code that is erroneous or incomplete. In a controlled study with 32 software engineers, we examined whether such imperfect outputs are helpful in the context of Java-to-Python code translation. When aided by the outputs of a code translation model, participants produced code with fewer errors than when working alone. We also examined how the quality and quantity of AI translations affected the work process and quality of outcomes, and observed that providing multiple translations had a larger impact on the translation process than varying the quality of provided translations. Our results tell a complex, nuanced story about the benefits of generative code models and the challenges software engineers face when working with their outputs. Our work motivates the need for intelligent user interfaces that help software engineers effectively work with generative code models in order to understand and evaluate their outputs and achieve superior outcomes to working alone.\n\n\n\nA Unifying Information-theoretic Perspective on Evaluating Generative Models\nAlexis Fox, S. Swarup, Abhijin Adiga\nAAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Considering the difficulty of interpreting generative model output, there is significant current research focused on determining meaningful evaluation metrics. Several recent approaches utilize &quot;precision&quot; and &quot;recall,&quot; borrowed from the classification domain, to individually quantify the output fidelity (realism) and output diversity (representation of the real data variation), respectively. With the increase in metric proposals, there is a need for a unifying perspective, allowing for easier comparison and clearer explanation of their benefits and drawbacks. To this end, we unify a class of kth-nearest neighbors (kNN)-based metrics under an information-theoretic lens using approaches from kNN density estimation. Additionally, we propose a tri-dimensional metric composed of Precision Cross-Entropy (PCE), Recall Cross-Entropy (RCE), and Recall Entropy (RE), which separately measure fidelity and two distinct aspects of diversity, inter- and intra-class. Our domain-agnostic metric, derived from the information-theoretic concepts of entropy and cross-entropy, can be dissected for both sample- and mode-level analysis. Our detailed experimental results demonstrate the sensitivity of our metric components to their respective qualities and reveal undesirable behaviors of other metrics.\n\n\n\nCoAuthor: Designing a Human-AI Collaborative Writing Dataset for Exploring Language Model Capabilities\nMina Lee, Percy Liang, Qian Yang\nInternational Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 2022\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Large language models (LMs) offer unprecedented language generation capabilities and exciting opportunities for interaction design. However, their highly context-dependent capabilities are difficult to grasp and are often subjectively interpreted. In this paper, we argue that by curating and analyzing large interaction datasets, the HCI community can foster more incisive examinations of LMs’ generative capabilities. Exemplifying this approach, we present CoAuthor, a dataset designed for revealing GPT-3’s capabilities in assisting creative and argumentative writing. CoAuthor captures rich interactions between 63 writers and four instances of GPT-3 across 1445 writing sessions. We demonstrate that CoAuthor can address questions about GPT-3’s language, ideation, and collaboration capabilities, and reveal its contribution as a writing “collaborator” under various definitions of good collaboration. Finally, we discuss how this work may facilitate a more principled discussion around LMs’ promises and pitfalls in relation to interaction design. The dataset and an interface for replaying the writing sessions are publicly available at coauthor.stanford.edu.\n\n\n\nThe Value, Benefits, and Concerns of Generative AI-Powered Assistance in Writing\nZhuoyan Li, Chen Liang, Jing Peng, Ming Yin\nInternational Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Recent advances in generative AI technologies like large language models raise both excitement and concerns about the future of human-AI co-creation in writing. To unpack people&#039;s attitude towards and experience with generative AI-powered writing assistants, in this paper, we conduct an experiment to understand whether and how much value people attach to AI assistance, and how the incorporation of AI assistance in writing workflows changes people&#039;s writing perceptions and performance. Our results suggest that people are willing to forgo financial payments to receive writing assistance from AI, especially if AI can provide direct content generation assistance and the writing task is highly creative. Generative AI-powered assistance is found to offer benefits in increasing people&#039;s productivity and confidence in writing. However, direct content generation assistance offered by AI also comes with risks, including decreasing people&#039;s sense of accountability and diversity in writing. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings.\n\n\n\nOf Human Criteria and Automatic Metrics: A Benchmark of the Evaluation of Story Generation\nCyril Chhun, Pierre Colombo, C. Clavel, Fabian M. Suchanek\nInternational Conference on Computational Linguistics 2022\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Research on Automatic Story Generation (ASG) relies heavily on human and automatic evaluation. However, there is no consensus on which human evaluation criteria to use, and no analysis of how well automatic criteria correlate with them. In this paper, we propose to re-evaluate ASG evaluation. We introduce a set of 6 orthogonal and comprehensive human criteria, carefully motivated by the social sciences literature. We also present HANNA, an annotated dataset of 1,056 stories produced by 10 different ASG systems. HANNA allows us to quantitatively evaluate the correlations of 72 automatic metrics with human criteria. Our analysis highlights the weaknesses of current metrics for ASG and allows us to formulate practical recommendations for ASG evaluation.\n\n\n\nMeasuring Diversity in Co-creative Image Generation\nF. Ibarrola, Kazjon Grace\nInternational Conference on Innovative Computing and Cloud Computing 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Quality and diversity have been proposed as reasonable heuristics for assessing content generated by co-creative systems, but to date there has been little agreement around what constitutes the latter or how to measure it. Proposed approaches for assessing generative models in terms of diversity have limitations in that they compare the model&#039;s outputs to a ground truth that in the era of large pre-trained generative models might not be available, or entail an impractical number of computations. We propose an alternative based on entropy of neural network encodings for comparing diversity between sets of images that does not require ground-truth knowledge and is easy to compute. We also compare two pre-trained networks and show how the choice relates to the notion of diversity that we want to evaluate. We conclude with a discussion of the potential applications of these measures for ideation in interactive systems, model evaluation, and more broadly within computational creativity.\n\n\n\nStrategies for Structuring Story Generation\nAngela Fan, M. Lewis, Yann Dauphin\nAnnual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics 2019\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Writers often rely on plans or sketches to write long stories, but most current language models generate word by word from left to right. We explore coarse-to-fine models for creating narrative texts of several hundred words, and introduce new models which decompose stories by abstracting over actions and entities. The model first generates the predicate-argument structure of the text, where different mentions of the same entity are marked with placeholder tokens. It then generates a surface realization of the predicate-argument structure, and finally replaces the entity placeholders with context-sensitive names and references. Human judges prefer the stories from our models to a wide range of previous approaches to hierarchical text generation. Extensive analysis shows that our methods can help improve the diversity and coherence of events and entities in generated stories.\n\n\n\nCrafting Narrative Closures: Zero-Shot Learning with SSM Mamba for Short Story Ending Generation\nDivyam Sharma, Divya Santhanam\narXiv.org 2024\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Writing stories is an engaging yet challenging endeavor. Often, authors encounter moments of creative block, where the path forward in their narrative becomes obscured. This paper is designed to address such moments by providing an innovative solution: A tool that completes stories based on given prompts. By inputting a short story prompt, users can receive a conclusion to their story, articulated in one sentence or more, thereby enhancing the storytelling process with AI-driven creativity. This tool aims not only to assist authors in navigating writer&#039;s block but also to offer a fun and interactive way for anyone to expand on story ideas spontaneously. Through this paper, we explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and creative writing, pushing the boundaries of how stories can be crafted and concluded. To create our final text-generation models, we used a pre-trained GPT-3.5 model and a newly created finetuned SSM-Mamba model, both of which perform well on a comprehensive list of metrics including BERT score, METEOR, BLEU, ROUGE, and Perplexity. The SSM model has also been made public for the NLP community on HuggingFace models as an open source contribution, which for the timebeing is a first of its kind state-space model for story-generation task on HuggingFace.\n\n\n\nRandom Network Distillation as a Diversity Metric for Both Image and Text Generation\nLiam H. Fowl, Micah Goldblum, Arjun Gupta, Amr Sharaf, T. Goldstein\narXiv.org 2020\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Generative models are increasingly able to produce remarkably high quality images and text. The community has developed numerous evaluation metrics for comparing generative models. However, these metrics do not effectively quantify data diversity. We develop a new diversity metric that can readily be applied to data, both synthetic and natural, of any type. Our method employs random network distillation, a technique introduced in reinforcement learning. We validate and deploy this metric on both images and text. We further explore diversity in few-shot image generation, a setting which was previously difficult to evaluate.\n\n\n\nOn Measuring Fairness in Generative Models\nMilad Abdollahzadeh, Ngai-Man Cheung, Christopher T. H. Teo\nNeural Information Processing Systems 2023\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   Recently, there has been increased interest in fair generative models. In this work, we conduct, for the first time, an in-depth study on fairness measurement, a critical component in gauging progress on fair generative models. We make three contributions. First, we conduct a study that reveals that the existing fairness measurement framework has considerable measurement errors, even when highly accurate sensitive attribute (SA) classifiers are used. These findings cast doubts on previously reported fairness improvements. Second, to address this issue, we propose CLassifier Error-Aware Measurement (CLEAM), a new framework which uses a statistical model to account for inaccuracies in SA classifiers. Our proposed CLEAM reduces measurement errors significantly, e.g., 4.98% $\\rightarrow$ 0.62% for StyleGAN2 w.r.t. Gender. Additionally, CLEAM achieves this with minimal additional overhead. Third, we utilize CLEAM to measure fairness in important text-to-image generator and GANs, revealing considerable biases in these models that raise concerns about their applications.

It is therefore important to quantitatively understand the nature of generated stories, and how they differ from human storytelling. We augment the Reddit WritingPrompts dataset with short stories generated by GPT-3.5, given the same prompts. We quantify and compare the emotional and descriptive features of storytelling from both generative processes, human and machine, along a set of six dimensions. We find that generated stories differ significantly from human stories along all six dimensions, and that human and machine generations display similar biases when grouped according to the narrative point-of-view and gender of the main protagonist. We release our dataset and code at github.com/KristinHuangg/gpt-writing-prompts.\n\n\n\nSynthetic Literature: Writing Science Fiction in a Co-Creative Process\nEnrique Manjavacas, Folgert Karsdorp, Ben Burtenshaw, M. Kestemont\nCC-NLG@INLG 2017\nopen paper page\n \n    Abstract \n   This paper describes a co-creative text generation system applied within a science fiction setting to be used by an established novelist. The project was initiated as part of The Dutch Book Week, and the generated text will be published within a volume of science fiction stories. We explore the ramifications of applying Natural Language Generation within a cocreative process, and examine where the cocreative setting challenges both writer and machine. We employ a character-level language model to generate text based on a large corpus of Dutch novels that exposes a number of tunable parameters to the user. The system is used through a custom graphical user interface, that helps the writer to elicit, modify and incorporate suggestions by the text generation system. Besides a literary work, the output of the present project also includes user-generated meta-data that is expected to contribute to the quantitative evaluation of the text-generation system and the co-creative process involved.\n\n\n"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Papers-to-Review-for-LangBiasGenImg":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Papers-to-Review-for-LangBiasGenImg","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Papers to Review for LangBiasGenImg.md","title":"Papers to Review for LangBiasGenImg","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"EMNLP 22\nHow well can Text-to-Image Generative Models understand Ethical Natural Language Interventions?\nMedCLIP: Contrastive Learning from Unpaired Medical Images and Text\nText-Only Training for Image Captioning using Noise-Injected CLIP\nClip-Tuning: Towards Derivative-free Prompt Learning with a Mixture of Rewards\nRelCLIP: Adapting Language-Image Pretraining for Visual Relationship Detection via Relational Contrastive Learning"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Partial-input-baselines-show-that-NLI-models-can-ignore-context,-but-they-don't":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Partial-input-baselines-show-that-NLI-models-can-ignore-context,-but-they-don't","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Partial-input baselines show that NLI models can ignore context, but they don't.md","title":"Partial-input baselines show that NLI models can ignore context, but they don't","links":["tags/paper-notes","01-Fleeting-Notes/NLI+-for-CoT"],"tags":["paper-notes"],"content":"2023-04-03 19:49\nTags: paper-notes\n\nPartial-input baselines show that NLI models can ignore context, but they don’t (2022)\nNeha Srikanth and Rachel Rudinger (UMD)\nTies back to the defeasible language inference (strengthener and weakener changes to sentences should be reflected in confidence) Thinking like a skeptic: defeasible inference in NL (2020)\nThis fits in with the NLI annotation artifacts story\n\nThey claim that because a human wouldn’t cheat on a dataset, it’s possible that NLI models aren’t necessarily cheating either and could still perform task the right way, pointing out that you’re starting from aritfacts that don’t have the inductive biases to cheat (generalized LMs)\nThey show that full-context (PSC) models are more confident than partial-context (SSC) and claim this suggests that this is evidence that contextual information is being used in the PSC and that model isn’t attending to SSC on high-confidence SSC examples\n\nIs this really true though?

Thus, we have to train on PSC and test on SSC, and PECO is an alternative metric of bias that captures this model-level separability of sentences in the SSC notion better than other approaches.\n\nIn particular, write a bit where we relate more closely to competency problems and dataset cartography\n\nFrom Reviewer Response Text\nWe will now respond to your main question, “why is PECO applied to a model that is trained on sentence pairs?” with an answer organized by (numbered) quotations from your review that are relevant to this point.\n(1) “PECO is computed based on a model trained on sentence pairs and therefore should receive a sentence pair at evaluation time.”\nYou describe why evaluating on sentence-pairs for clustering would be futile later in your comment:\n(2) “If the model does receive a sentence pair for computing PECO, clusters are to be expected and there is no way to distinguish good clusters from bad (shortcut) clusters.”\nYou are correct to point out that in observing clusters in the paired sentence condition (PSC), there’s no way to tell “good” clusters apart from shortcut clusters. However, in the single sentence condition (SSC), the only class label-separating clusters that can exist, must be shortcut clusters. This is because such clusters visible in the SSC (whether the model is trained on SSC or PSC) is indicative of information that the model can use to discern the label classes apart when only one sentence is shown, which violates the pairwise nature of the definition of the NLI task.\nWhile this answers why we must evaluate on single sentences for PECO, it alone doesn’t address your further point regarding training on PSC and evaluating on SSC:\n(3) “viewing single sentences during feature extraction for PECO score assessment is a very different setup to what the model was exposed to during finetuning (distribution shift!) and it’s not clear to what degree its single sentence representations from a sentence pair model is meaningful for the task of NLI”\nWe agree with you that the meaningfulness of single sentence embeddings to the task of NLI is questionable; in fact, in the ideal case these embeddings should carry 0 relevant information to the NLI task, were a leakage-free dataset to exist.\nPECO is built on the assumption that for such an ideal NLI dataset, all information relevant to PSC classification SHOULD be lost under the distribution shift that occurs when a single-sentence condition (SSC) population is considered. Thus, we treat finding whether this takes place or not for a given (model, dataset) combination as a proxy for the biasedness of the dataset.\nTo do this we train a classifier to convergence on the PSC population (leading to a high test accuracy in PSC and separation of the label classes in the final embedding space of the classification head) and then estimate which of these features continue to be visible to the model in the SSC, by observing the separability of label classes in said embedding space. Your understanding of the cluster shifting is aligned with our fundamental assumption. \n(4) “Neural networks are known to behave strangely under distribution shift.”\nRegrettably, we did a poor job of explaining how we mitigate the impact of the distribution shift beyond the desired loss of representational separation (for an ideal dataset) in the manuscript. Rather than feeding in a sample strictly containing the single sentence, we input “lesioned” sentence pairs, which preserve the structure of “ s1  s2 ”, but have all tokens in either s1 or s2 zeroed out at both the input token embedding and attention mask levels. This way the samples continue to have the structure of sentence pairs. Although this clarifying detail will be identifiable to those who read our source code, we have added this to the appendices for the final draft to alleviate confusion.\nTo recap, our goal in computing PECO is precisely to identify the degree to which model-visible separation of label classes is possible in SSC, which as you pointed out should be axiomatically impossible. Our emphasis in finding biases the model actually uses is why we train on PSC and test on SSC for PECO, and we have taken measures to minimize the impact that this domain shift has on producing strange behaviors, beyond the expected loss of separation due to information loss. Hopefully, these remarks have answered your question satisfactorily."},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Subjectivity-in-LM-analysis-support,-overleaf-draft":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Subjectivity-in-LM-analysis-support,-overleaf-draft","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Subjectivity in LM analysis support, overleaf draft.md","title":"Subjectivity in LM analysis support, overleaf draft","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Rao: AI as an Ersatz Natural Science? cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/261732-ai-as-an-ersatz-natural-science/fulltext\nSubjective and more subjective hype-fueling analysis:\nTeaching models to express their uncertainty in words arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14334.pdf\nEMNLP THeme paper: www.overleaf.com/project/6296937e4034478075a18a64\nMSFT proposal (same text): www.overleaf.com/project/62916d35de6fa13dbe23612c\nMSFT details: www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-fellowship/canada-us/"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/T2I-Model-Zoo-Provenance":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/T2I-Model-Zoo-Provenance","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/T2I Model Zoo Provenance.md","title":"T2I Model Zoo Provenance","links":["tags/blog-idea","tags/t2i"],"tags":["blog-idea","t2i"],"content":"blog-idea t2i\nThere are a lot of great posts out there explaining how diffusion models for text-guided image synthesis (and other text-to-image models more broadly) work.

In my view, it is the originator of the LLM prompting paradigm. After pretraining on the C4 corpus, T5 was simultaneously fine-tuned on diverse NLP tasks including NLI, paraphrasing, summarization, and translation. Which capability is engaged during inference is not determined through some external routing module or direct conditioning switch, but inline, as text, with the rest of the input, eg. translate English to German: That is good.\n\nGiven the mature state of transfer learning at the time, that shared representations could benefit all the tasks in a parameter efficient manner was a reasonable prediction, which was vindicated by the success of the model. But as a novice NLPer at the time I was quite surprised that an LM could both process its instructions and perform the specified task so well at the time; even though GPT-2 had already been found too dangerous to be released shown able to complete impressive, novel writing segments, I hadn’t seen such strikingly good instruction-guided outputs before.\nDespite this, I caught in 2022 for calling T5 the genesis of prompting, as it isn’t a decoder model, and the large multitask decoder LMs of 2022 weren’t being trained to be prompted as T5 was either.\nIn 2024, though, I feel pretty vindicated. I would submit our use paradigm for LMs is now closer to the T5 paradigm than it was a couple years back.\n2022 was a heady time.

I distinctly recall being surprised each time by the “unicorn story” generated by GPT-2, early evidence for the efficacy of task-specific prompting in T5, EXAMPLES EXAMPLES EXAMPLES emergent properties etc\nHowever there are some issues in the discourse around LLMs. First off, I think a degree of unreasonable foresight being retroactively claimed by eg. Sam Altman, motivated from a supposed “predictable” nature of gains in LM performance with scale. I think an important first step is to closely examine what these scaling laws actually are: blah blah blah\nIn fact, I am generally troubled by our rhetorical choice to describe what can more fairly be called “scaling observations” to laws. I believe a core inspiration for these observation-driven prognostications is Moore’s Law, which despite it’s name is not a natural law---it was first an academic observation in the late 1950s, which was then made an R&amp;D target in 1965 by the leadership of Fairchild Semiconductor and then later Intel.\nFor Moore’s law, the driving inputs were ever-shifting over time, while the main output variable---device complexity---remained fixed. Despite its seemingly slippery name, device complexity was in fact a measurable quantity, area transistor density at a fixed price. Realizing the business goal of Moore’s law required coordinating refinements to a shifting array of innovations, in terms of transistor design, materials, and fabrication process. In the 60s it was CMOS, in the 80s it was UV photolithography, more recently there has been a focus on 3D assembly of components. (Don’t hold me too closely on the above, I only have an undergraduate-level of EE knowledge, which was focused on signal processing anyway)\nMeanwhile, when it comes to the LLM “scaling laws,” there are several complications in relating them to other technology forecasting methods like Moore’s law. First of all, there’s not a unified LLM scaling law theory---different people (and sometimes the same people on different occasions) mean really different things when they make statements like “the gains in LLM performance are very predictable with scale.” Usually the sophisticated people who make this statement mean it rigorously, and they are referring to something like better perplexity performance over a larger dataset in compute-optimal conditions. However, audiences unfamiliar with the technical details of LLMs hear (and hype agents state) a non-rigorous version of the scaling hypothesis, referring to fuzzy concepts like “reasoning,” “understanding,” and the like. Despite my distaste for thinking of these concepts as following some kind of scaling law, I totally understand the interest---the shockingly impressive ability for systems like GPT-4 to act according to our intent from underspecified prompts across many domains and to generate fluent text and code are what we’re really excited about in these systems, not the ability for them to have a lower per-token surprisal over big datasets than previous techniques!\nThe fact that we can’t measure the thing we really care about is a massive problem, so big that at this point I believe it is the root of many of the issues in current AI discourse. I think this is where the assignment of sentience to LLMs comes from. I think this is what allows the magical thinking around AI doomerism to gain purchase. I think this is why we’re at a dead end in evaluation and all people can think to do is test LLMs on standardized tests. I think this is why psychologists, economists, and philosophers are trying to rush in and claim relevance by assigning things like a theory of mind or …\nI think this is why Eliezer Yudkowsky gets taken seriously.\n…\nWe really need a new science of “LLMology” that can answer these questions, and I think it will require novel theories and techniques that aren’t really comparable to any other field that has come before. While I’m very skeptical of the superintelligence crowd, I think even they should support this kind of a science. A better understanding of LLM capabilities will give us a better understnading of the risks they pose, if they do pose any. And perhaps if they do, having hard data to support the subjective AGI-like improvements that LLMs have given\nFirst is that there’s confusion over what exactly the dependent variable in the scaling relationship is. I see there being effectively a rigorous LLM scaling law claim and a vibe-based scaling law. I think a lot of people in the hype crowd like to play a rhetorical game where the strength of the rigorous claim is used to advocate for the vibe-based one.\nequation is flipped. As far as I understand it, the strong scaling hypothesis for LLMs is that with a paired increase in\nChinchilla arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556\nScaling laws for NLMs arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361 (Kaplan ea 2020 in Chinchilla)\nIt never hurts to be overly-optimistic about how LMs will work on your research task (LMaaJ skepticism)"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/The-parts-of-yourself-that-you-exercise-get-stronger":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/The-parts-of-yourself-that-you-exercise-get-stronger","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/The parts of yourself that you exercise get stronger.md","title":"The parts of yourself that you exercise get stronger","links":["01-Fleeting-Notes/The-parts-of-yourself-that-you-exercise-get-stronger"],"tags":[],"content":"A line from Ezra Klein on Hasan Minhaj about the reason why it is bad, actually to have actively unvirtuous people out and HAPPILY reveling in their cruelty and vice, responding to the cope people say about the “deportation ASMR” type shit saying that at least the cruelty that’s always been there is out in the open.\nHe’s talking about the “personality transplants.”\n“Back in the Hillbilly Elegy days, decency was very important to him.

LM as a judge is pretty closely related to my research vision. However, LMaaJ only evaluates models post hoc from their outputs. I think what we really need is a system that dynamically elicits behavior from the model under test. The principal distinction I’d make between this work and my research agenda is that I want to make the planner both devise what the inputs are going to be and check them, rather than just checking outputs of predetermined inputs here.\nHere are some more granular thoughts.\nI really like seeing:\n\nhow using self-guidance to generate the samples for SFT+DPO  can be applied to scale LM judges\ncasting the task of building LM judges as something to automate rather than assuming human prompt engineering\nhow such a simple method performs well on all those different benchmarks\n\nThat being said, there are some limitations\n\nThey are assessing a well-worn set of judging tasks: correctness in world-knowledge QA, rule-following for things like length and output format, and refusal. Basically, it’s all chatbot stuff\nThey only look at pairwise evaluation, which is useful for coarse, relative system comparisons (and to a limited extent FT data filtering) but cannot be applied for absolute system acceptability judgements, which I think is the more important and difficult task\nThis method may be brittle to harder desiderata in more complex domains\n\nBy strictly using self-learning to select training samples, the model probably won’t improve much in the kinds of “plans” it can execute\nIn their Fig 1. example, they show it can check that the correct list of attributes are provided, and formatted correctly, but what about more complex, deeper info? Recall of fundamental facts? Stylistic attributes? This technique has no answer for this\nAnd addressing that issue is hard: within a pairwise preference signal attributes such as informativeness or recall over specific necessary input information probably won’t be caught, I suspect this is the same problem we have in tying vision+language modalities, there is not a sufficient supervisory signal for the model to fit everything we want it to\n\n\n\nI definitely think this method will be an important part of the toolbox for this research vision. At the very least as a baseline. I think natural follow ups to this work to address these limitations may include:\n\nIdentifying more complex domains than pairwise evaluation, maybe style or information preservation, and looking for supervisory signals on Likert scales\nDeveloping an evaluation planner that can use tools instead of just executing the entire evaluation plan LM-modulo (this would allow it to be better applied to code gen tasks for example)\nInvestigating if this technique can make a “base model” for LMaaJ to bootstrap a small set of gold preference pairs into a judge for some specialized task.\nAdding “building the input plan” as part of the evaluation.\n"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/To-read":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/To-read","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/To read.md","title":"To read","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"On The Beach"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Tool-use-t2i":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Tool-use-t2i","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Tool use t2i.md","title":"Tool use t2i","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"SEPHIROTH\nAERITH\nBARRET\nCLOUD\nSNAKE\nAgentic\nEvaluation\nR\nImage\nTool\nHandling\nSegment\nN\nA\nK\nEvaluation\nTool-use\nSegmentation\nCounting\nModular\nRequirement"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/Towards-Behavior-Driven-AI-Development":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/Towards-Behavior-Driven-AI-Development","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/Towards Behavior-Driven AI Development.md","title":"Towards Behavior-Driven AI Development","links":["tags/blogpost-notes","02-Document-Notes/Master-list-of-todos-for-PECO-EACL-camready"],"tags":["blogpost-notes"],"content":"2023-03-28 17:15\nTags: blogpost-notes\n\nBlogpost link\nBased on a paper called Zeno: An Interactive Framework for Behavioral Evaluation of Machine Learning\n\nUseful for mining for future reference\nIt is a currently active Python package for use in dataset analysis, but it lacks the powerful integrations with training models that I’m building\n\nRelates to Master list of todos for PECO EACL camready\n\nThey basically have a startup containing a much more capable copy of DatasetAnalysis\nThey sell this as being an enabler of “Behavior-driven AI dev” which is a desirable paradigm to them\n\nThey rightfully point out that many important elements aside from accuracy under numerical metrics are desirable\n\nThey point to the fact that there are ad hoc fairness toolkits, robustness analysis libraries, etc\n\nAll good to investigate as integrations\nThey exclusively work on the problem of “behavior as performance on metadata-identified subgroups”\n\nWorth considering looking into behavior on automatically-identified subgroups\n\n\n"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/We-Need-a-Team-America-Mentality-for-Tech":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/We-Need-a-Team-America-Mentality-for-Tech","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/We Need a Team America Mentality for Tech.md","title":"We Need a Team America Mentality for Tech","links":["tags/blog-idea"],"tags":["blog-idea"],"content":"2023-04-01 19:55\nTags: blog-idea\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch\nTeam America: World Police includes some brutal mockery of celebrity condemnations toward the Iraq war.

The Enlightenment did not, as it turns out, vanquish Religion, driving it far from the pure realms of Science and Technology. In fact, to the degree that the radical Enlightenment’s assault on religious faith was successful, it empowered the religion of technology. To put this another way, the Enlightenment—and, yes, we are painting with broad strokes here—did not do away with the notions of Providence, Heaven, and Grace. Rather, the Enlightenment re-framed these as Progress, Utopia, and Technology respectively. If heaven had been understood as a transcendent goal achieved with the aid of divine grace within the context of the providentially ordered unfolding of human history, it became a Utopian vision, a heaven on earth, achieved by the ministrations Science and Technology within the context of Progress, an inexorable force driving history toward its Utopian consummation\n6.

Use the right one!\nFor a long time researchers in NLP have used language modeling as a way to create concrete proxy measures for linguistic complexity, difficulty, or reading time by employing information-theoretic measures that can be derived from LMs.\nThe perplexity of some source X following distribution p is defined as the exponentiated entropy H\nPPL(p)=2^{H(p)}=2^{-\\sum p(x)\\log p(x)}=\\prod_xp(x)^{-p(x)}\nThis “surprisal” is …\nIn Jurafsky and Martin they introduce the other kind of perplexity, intended to assess how well fit model p is to the training distribution X actually involves computing the cross-entropy between the model’s probability distribution p and the empirical, observed distribution of X, or H(p,q).\nH(p,q) corresponds to the expected value of -E_p[\\log(q)], or:\nH_X(p,q)=-\\sum_{x \\in X}q(x)\\log(p(x))\nWe can do a useful trick: the set of elements in X represents the empirical probability distribution of X. If x_i is present in X n times, then q(x_i)=n/|X|, and x_i will show up n times in the sum! So, we have\nH_X(p,q)=-\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{x\\in X}log(p(x))\nIn turn, this gives us the LM fit perplexity, for model p, or:\nPPL_\\textrm{LM}(p,X)=2^{H_{X}(p,q)}=2^{-1/N\\sum_{x\\in X}\\log(p(x))} = something\\prod_xp(x)\nThis is very useful: all you need to do to check how well-fit a model is to a collection of text is take the product of the LM head posterior prob. (confidence) in the correct token!\nBut, the only reason this formulation is equivalent is because we are measuring the degree of fit of the LM probability model p to the empirical distribution. When we are using an LM to characterize small populations of specific text we don’t want to assume we are seeing the true distribution.\nThe problem is sometimes NLP researchers want to evaluate models, and other times they want to evaluate text!\n in text and data generated by models, and am interested in relating this to outputs from other models as well as humans. In this setting terminological issues can sometimes arise.\nArgument about perplexity in a review"},"01-Fleeting-Notes/abstracts-for-talks":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/abstracts-for-talks","filePath":"01 Fleeting Notes/abstracts for talks.md","title":"abstracts for talks","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"defense\nA fundamental open question in AI research is: “how can we confidently know what a model can reliably do?” Currently, we often discover model limitations through post-deployment failures rather than proactive assessment. I will present novel methodologies for rigorous pre-deployment evaluation, focusing on generative text-to-image models in multilingual and multicultural contexts. In this talk, I will introduce new frameworks for analyzing these models’ cross-cultural knowledge representation and performance, presenting previously unidentified optimization challenges in balancing multiple competing objectives: cross-language consistency, preservation of cultural nuance, and mitigation of harmful biases. Through careful empirical analysis, this work has revealed significant gaps in existing evaluation approaches and challenged several commonly held assumptions about model capabilities. The methodologies introduced here extend beyond text-to-image models, offering broader insights into AI system assessment. I will demonstrate how more precise evaluation techniques can uncover unexpected failure modes and provide clearer pathways for future research in reliable AI development, leading to better empirical progress, scientific understanding, developer informedness, and public awareness.\nGoogle\nTitle: On multimodal metrics and multilingual text-to-image models\nAbstract: Evaluating multimodal models is hard, yet there are lots of interesting things to evaluate! In this work I will present two projects about evaluating text-to-image (T2I) models. First I will talk about prompt coherence metrics, which analyze whether a generated image reflects the semantics requirements of its prompt. It turns out that due to poor meta-evaluation of these metrics, the T2I community mistakenly focuses on overly expensive techniques to evaluate their models. Then, I will talk about a line of work evaluating the multilingual and multicultural performance of T2I models. Despite being trained on ostensibly English-only data, many T2I models pick up inconsistent multilingual performance as well as positive and negative secondary behaviors, memorizing implicit cultural knowledge and perpetuating language-specific harmful output trends. Carefully introducing new evaluation targets presents new avenues for understanding and improving models."},"01-Fleeting-Notes/linkdump":{"slug":"01-Fleeting-Notes/linkdump","filePath":"01 Fleeting

Impossible Metals has developed an autonomous underwater vehicle that uses robotic claws to extract polymetallic nodules, which are rich in minerals like manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated that accessing these resources responsibly would support American economic growth and national security. These nodules have attracted attention due to their high mineral concentrations, far exceeding those found in terrestrial mines. Ecologists and oceanographers have warned that deep-sea mining could disrupt fragile ecosystems, which would take decades to recover from the disruption. A recent study found that microbial communities would need 50 years to recover from mining operations. Sponges and other sea creatures could be harmed, and sediment plumes could pollute the water.\nWhy does this matter?\nEnvironmental Impact: The article highlights the potential ecological consequences of deep-sea mining. Given the slow recovery rates of deep-sea ecosystems, the environmental disruption could be significant, impacting microbial communities and marine life. The fact that the nodules themselves produce oxygen is an unexpected detail that could be important.\nResource Security: The push for deep-sea mining is driven by the increasing demand for critical minerals needed for electrification and the desire to reduce reliance on countries like China. This could be a significant shift in how resources are sourced, with potential geopolitical implications.\nTechnological Innovation: Impossible Metals claims its UAV is less disruptive than competitors using vacuums. This introduces the question of how best to evaluate competing claims of lower environmental impact of new technologies.\nRead more\n\nA comprehensive list of 2025 tech layoffs\n\nSource: TechCrunch\nSummary\nTechCrunch is tracking tech layoffs in 2025, noting over 22,000 job cuts so far this year.

This acquisition marks OpenAI’s largest to date, aiming to create AI-powered devices and secure the expertise of Ive and his team, who were instrumental in designing iconic Apple products. According to Bloomberg, “The purchase… will provide the company with a dedicated unit for developing AI-powered devices. Acquiring the secretive startup, named io, also will secure the services of Ive and other former Apple designers who were behind iconic products such as the iPhone.”\nThe acquisition also includes approximately 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists, and product development specialists from io, many of whom are former Apple designers. While Ive will retain control of his design firm, LoveFrom, he and his team will lead creative and design efforts at OpenAI, influencing future versions of ChatGPT and other projects, according to The New York Times. Ive and Altman have been working on a device that moves consumers “beyond screens,” with the first devices expected to debut in 2026, and a desire to find some physical embodiment for AI systems to interact with users, according to comments in the coverage by both Bloomberg and TechCrunch.\nHacker News commenters express skepticism about the acquisition, particularly regarding the valuation, the lack of a clear product from io, and Jony Ive’s track record since leaving Apple. Concerns are raised about OpenAI’s strategic direction, with some suggesting that the company is losing focus on core AI research and is instead pursuing expensive acquisitions to maintain relevance. Several commenters also point out that the all-stock deal may be a way for OpenAI to manage its cash flow and dilute the ownership of its non-profit entity.\nTop Comments Summary\nThe Hacker News comments section is largely critical of the acquisition. Common themes include:\n\nSkepticism about Ive’s post-Apple performance: Commenters question Ive’s ability to replicate his past success, citing design failures such as the butterfly keyboard and the removal of ports from MacBooks. One commenter said, “Ive did good designs when Jobs kept him in check. Once Jobs was gone he messed up a whole generation of MacBooks.”\nConcerns about OpenAI’s strategic direction: Some commenters feel that OpenAI is losing focus on AI research and is instead making expensive acquisitions to stay relevant. One commenter wrote, “This is a sign of OpenAI’s weakness. Altman is desperately trying to use OpenAI’s inflated valuation to buy some kind of advantage.”\nDoubts about the valuation and lack of product: Many question the $6.5 billion valuation of io, especially given the absence of a tangible product or even a website. One commenter stated, “It’s mind boggling how much money is floating around once you are part of the insider circle. What has that company been doing to be worth 6.5 billion?”\nCriticism of Sam Altman: Some commenters express distrust of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, citing concerns about his past actions and motivations. One commenter suggested that the acquisition is a way for Altman to extract value from OpenAI for personal gain: “Sam Altman who planned and executed the extraction of Reddit from Condé Nast… - Step 2: you acquire that entity, valuing it unreasonably high so that the nonprofit’s stake is diluted.”\nComparisons to past tech failures: Several commenters draw parallels to past tech failures, such as the Facebook phone and the Humane AI pin, suggesting that OpenAI’s hardware venture may face similar challenges. One commenter asked: “How did that work for the Facebook phone? And all their billions of fervent Facebook users?”\nThe nature of the deal Commenters are suspicious of it being an “all stock deal” and what that really means, such as whether this might not be an “acqui-hire”\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nIndustry consolidation and talent acquisition: The acquisition signifies the ongoing consolidation in the AI industry and the importance of attracting top talent, particularly in design. This trend could influence how AI research and development are structured and funded, with larger players potentially dominating the landscape.\nHardware strategy and product development: OpenAI’s push into hardware raises questions about the future of AI interfaces and the potential for AI to move beyond software applications. This development could shape the design and functionality of future AI-powered devices, with a focus on creating more seamless and intuitive user experiences.\nEthical and societal implications: The development of AI-powered devices raises ethical concerns about data privacy, surveillance, and the potential for misuse. Understanding the societal impact of these technologies will be crucial for responsible AI development and deployment.\n\nPotential Relevance to Research\n\nAI evaluation: The success or failure of OpenAI’s AI-powered devices could provide valuable data for evaluating the effectiveness of current AI evaluation metrics. Does this move make a difference relative to current LLMs, and can the difference be quantified? Rigorous evaluation of these devices will be necessary to assess their real-world performance and identify potential limitations. The article mentions comments from Ive regarding the failures of similar attempts, such as the Humane pin. Can these failures be quantified with current metrics?\nMultimodal AI: The development of AI devices will likely require advancements in multimodal AI, integrating language, vision, audio, and other modalities. The challenges and opportunities in this area could inform your research on multimodal models and their applications.\nMulticultural AI One of the comments notes: “German has a word for second hand embarrassment. Fremdschämen. Comes in very handy here. If Sam continues like this it won’t be long until it becomes part of the regular English language like other German words such as Kindergarten. And I’ll be happy that I don’t have to explain Fremdschämen anymore. Everything has its upsides.” This comment about “Fremdschamen” as a possible new word in the English language that has come as a result of developments in AI reflects the impact on languages worldwide with the new technology.\n\nRead more\nRelated Articles\n\nJony Ive to lead OpenAI’s design work following $6.5B acquisition of his company\nOpenAI Unites With Jony Ive in $6.5 Billion Deal to Create A.I.

The client may find it useful to understand the basis of these accusations and how LM Arena plans to address them.\nMultimodal generative AI: Given that LM Arena is used to evaluate flagship models from the largest AI vendors, any evaluations of multimodality would be very relevant.\nEthical AI: Since the funding will be used to support the project’s continued research on “reliable AI”, it may be valuable to understand the implications of this research on the client’s research in ethical AI.\n\nRead more\n\nWhat AI Thinks It Knows About You\n\nSource: The Atlantic\nSummary\nThe article discusses the challenges of understanding how large language models (LLMs) work and the potential implications of their increasing use in our lives. The author, Jonathan L. Zittrain, highlights the issue of interpretability, or the ability to explain how a model arrives at a particular output. While companies like Anthropic and Meta are making progress in this area, LLMs remain largely “black boxes.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai admitted in a 60 Minutes interview that “There is an aspect of this which we call—all of us in the field call it as a ‘black box.’ You know, you don’t fully understand. And you can’t quite tell why it said this, or why it got wrong.”\nThe article delves into research by Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg at Harvard, who discovered that LLMs form assumptions about their users based on factors such as gender, socioeconomic status, education level, and age. These assumptions can then influence the model’s responses, leading to potentially biased or stereotypical recommendations. The ability to see these assumptions in real time, using a dashboard built by the Harvard researchers, reveals the extent to which LLMs rely on stereotypes gleaned from their training data.\nZittrain raises concerns about the implications of LLMs gathering information about users through unguarded conversations and the potential for manipulation or misuse of this information. He argues for a “clear sphere of protection” between LLMs and their users, similar to the protections afforded to conversations between lawyers and clients or doctors and patients. He argues that model makers and operators must commit to ensuring that models function as harmless, helpful, and honest friends.\nWhy This Matters\nModel Metrology: The article touches on the difficulty of understanding and evaluating LLMs. The discussion of “interpretability” and the “black box” nature of these models underscores the need for more rigorous and scientific approaches to evaluating their capabilities, biases, and potential for misuse. The work by Anthropic and the Harvard researchers suggests that progress is being made in understanding the inner workings of these models, opening up new avenues for evaluation and improvement.\nMulticultural AI: The research by Viégas and Wattenberg, specifically Viégas’s experience with ChatGPT in Portuguese, highlights the importance of considering cultural and linguistic nuances in AI development. The discovery of gender-based stereotypes in LLMs demonstrates the need for careful examination of training data and model behavior to ensure fairness and inclusivity across different languages and cultures. The point about the LLM not being able to discern nonbinary gender designations due to a limited number of examples in the training data would be useful.\nAgentic Systems and Ethical AI: Zittrain’s concerns about the potential for LLMs to be used for manipulation or to provide harmful information raise important ethical questions about the development and deployment of agentic AI systems. The example of a car-dealership AI sales assistant illustrates how these systems could exploit user data for commercial gain, while the hypothetical scenario of an AI providing bomb-making instructions highlights the potential for misuse. The call for a “clear sphere of protection” between LLMs and their users underscores the need for ethical guidelines and regulations to ensure that these systems are used responsibly and in a way that protects user autonomy and agency.\nRead more\n\nEinride founder steps down as CEO amid push to scale electric, autonomous trucks\n\nSource: TechCrunch\nSummary\nEinride founder Robert Falck is stepping down as CEO to become executive chairman, focusing on long-term strategy and a potential IPO.

This choice is notable because Finland has the most metal bands per capita and Lim’s band is popular in Finland. Lim stated that “Working with my partners in the Finnish music industry for a long time has made me have a special feeling for this country.” Beyond his musical career, Lim’s selection is attributed to his human rights advocacy and experience in international exchange, including his service as a legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan. Lim founded Chthonic in 1995, incorporating Taiwanese mythology into their music, which led to international recognition after their 2005 album and a spot in Ozzfest.\nWhy does this matter?\nThis appointment signals a shift in diplomatic norms, potentially opening doors for individuals from diverse backgrounds, including artists, to engage in international relations. The appointment also reflects Taiwan’s focus on leveraging cultural connections in its foreign policy. It demonstrates that cultural ambassadors can be very effective for international relations, particularly when cultural interests are shared.\nRead more\n\nIntroducing the Llama Startup Program\n\nSource: Hacker News\nHere’s a summary of the Llama Startup Program article and its potential relevance:\nSummary\nMeta has launched the “Llama for Startups” program to encourage the adoption of its Llama AI models among U.S.-based startups. The program offers direct support from Meta’s Llama team and, in some cases, up to $6,000 per month for six months to help offset the costs of building generative AI solutions.

It comes at a time when Meta is facing challenges, including reported delays in the rollout of its Llama 4 Behemoth model due to underperformance on key benchmarks and allegations of cheating on the LM Arena benchmark by using a version of Llama 4 Maverick optimized for conversationality. Despite these setbacks, Meta anticipates its generative AI products will generate significant revenue in the coming years, projecting $2 billion to $3 billion in 2025 and potentially reaching between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion by 2035. Meta’s “GenAI” budget is substantial, exceeding $900 million in 2024 and potentially surpassing $1 billion this year, with plans to invest $60 billion to $80 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, primarily for new data centers.\nHacker News Comments\nThere are no comments available for the Hacker News link provided.\nWhy does this matter?\n\nOpen Model Competition: The program signals Meta’s commitment to the open-source AI model space and its efforts to compete with other major players like Google and Alibaba. Meta’s strategy of incentivizing startups to use Llama could foster a broader ecosystem and influence the direction of generative AI development.\nModel Evaluation and Benchmarking: The mention of Llama 4 Behemoth’s delayed release due to benchmark underperformance and the controversy surrounding Meta’s LM Arena performance highlights the challenges in rigorously evaluating and benchmarking AI models, especially concerning conversationality and real-world performance.\nMulticultural AI Implications: A broader Llama ecosystem could foster uses of Llama in different languages and cultural contexts, especially in the many startups that are popping up in Asia, Europe, Africa, and elsewhere.\nCost and Investment: The massive investment Meta is making in generative AI, including the “GenAI” budget and infrastructure spending, underscores the significant resources required to develop and deploy these models, raising questions about the sustainability and accessibility of AI development.\n\nRead more\nRelated Articles\n\nMeta launches program to encourage startups to use its Llama AI models\n\n\nJapan’s agriculture minister resigns after his remark about not having to buy rice\n\nSource: NPR World\nSummary\nJapan’s Agriculture Minister, Taku Eto, resigned following public backlash over his remark about “never having to buy rice” because he received it as gifts from supporters. This comment was deemed insensitive given the record high rice prices and economic struggles faced by the Japanese public. Eto acknowledged the inappropriateness of his statement and its impact on consumers. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted the resignation as the government attempts to manage rice prices and supply. The government has been releasing rice from its emergency stockpile, but this has not significantly alleviated the price issue. Some supermarkets have started selling cheaper imported rice. Eto clarified that his comment referred to brown rice and that he does buy white rice himself. Media reports suggest that Shinjiro Koizumi, son of a former prime minister, will succeed Eto. Ishiba plans to strengthen Japan’s food security, but critics emphasize the need to address the immediate rice price issue. Ishiba suspects the rice price surge is a “structural problem.” The supply shortfall began with panic buying after earthquake warnings, and officials cite poor harvests and increased production costs as contributing factors. Some experts, however, blame the government’s long-term rice production policy.\nShizuko Oshima, 73, stated, “Rice is the stable food for the Japanese. When its prices are rising every week, (Eto’s) resignation is only natural.” The government denies a shortage but acknowledges distribution problems since the end of government control in 1995, making it difficult to trace the rice supply.\nWhy Does This Matter?\nPolitical Instability: The resignation highlights the vulnerability of Prime Minister Ishiba’s minority government, especially with upcoming national elections. The scandal and potential no-confidence vote could lead to significant political changes.\nEconomic Impact: The surge in rice prices reflects broader economic pressures on Japanese consumers, indicating a need for effective government intervention in food supply and pricing mechanisms. The situation underscores the sensitivity around staple food costs and their impact on public sentiment.\nFood Security: The article raises concerns about Japan’s food security and self-sufficiency. Ishiba’s plans for agricultural reform, including increased rice production and exports, suggest a long-term strategy to address these issues, even as the immediate crisis requires urgent solutions. The reference to “panic buying following a government caution over preparedness for a major earthquake” highlights the role of public perception on food security.\nRead more\n\nA tale of murder, artificial intelligence, &amp; forgiveness\n\nSource: NPR Technology\nSummary\nAn AI avatar of murder victim Chris Pelkey addressed his killer in court, potentially marking the first instance of an AI-generated victim impact statement accepted in a U.S. court. The avatar was created by Pelkey’s sister, who sought to offer forgiveness to the killer. This event raises questions about the evolving relationship between AI and the legal system, its potential impact on the public’s understanding of justice, and broader cultural implications. NPR interviewed Juliana Kim and Brandon Blankenship to explore these issues.\nWhy this matters\nLegal Precedent and Ethical Considerations: The acceptance of an AI-generated victim impact statement sets a legal precedent with uncertain consequences. It raises ethical questions about the extent to which AI can represent human emotion and intent, especially from deceased individuals. There is a risk that this could open the door for the exploitation of victims or the manipulation of legal proceedings.\nCultural Impact on Justice and Forgiveness: This event sparks a conversation about how AI may reshape societal norms regarding justice and forgiveness. The use of an AI avatar to convey forgiveness challenges traditional notions of closure and reconciliation, potentially altering how individuals process grief and seek justice. The introduction of AI into such sensitive contexts may also desensitize individuals to the emotional weight of these proceedings.\nPotential Insights for AI Research\nThis article highlights potential applications of generative AI, specifically concerning AI expression of emotion. This intersects with evaluation of AI systems, particularly how to measure the appropriateness and impact of AI-generated content in sensitive contexts such as legal proceedings. Determining if an AI-generated expression of forgiveness has the same effect as a human one falls under the umbrella of capability assessment, which your research touches on. Furthermore, this is an example of an end-user application for agentic systems and poses important questions about how these systems should be deployed, and what could go wrong.\nRead more\n\n‘MAGA is a big lesson to us’: Suntory’s Niinami on tariffs, Japanese dealmakers, and inclusive capitalism\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nTakeshi “Tak” Niinami, CEO of Suntory, reflects on the lessons learned from the MAGA movement and its implications for businesses globally. He argues that the rise of populism, exemplified by Donald Trump’s presidency, stems from societal “anger, mistrust, and anxiety” arising from old-fashioned capitalism that hasn’t benefited everyone. Niinami urges corporate leaders to embrace “inclusive” capitalism, redistributing wealth and compensating those negatively impacted by globalization. He criticizes Big Tech executives for benefiting from globalization without adequately addressing its adverse effects on ordinary workers.\nNiinami also discusses the impact of Trump’s trade policies on consumer behavior, noting a “trade-down” effect where consumers opt for cheaper alternatives due to tariff-induced anxieties. He shares Suntory’s experience of navigating these challenges by stockpiling products and managing price pressures. Reflecting on Suntory’s acquisition of Beam, Niinami emphasizes the importance of cultural integration and strong leadership from the acquiring company to avoid common pitfalls in Japanese-US business deals. He highlights the need for Japanese companies to be less “naive” and more assertive in managing their US subsidiaries.\nLooking ahead, Niinami sees a turning point for corporate Japan, with companies holding significant excess cash. He encourages them to invest in new frontiers and acquisitions rather than focusing solely on stock repurchases or dividends. He also expresses concerns about geopolitical risks, including China’s actions in the Taiwan Strait and the potential dangers of unregulated AI. Niinami stresses the importance of corporate sustainability efforts in building trust with societies and calls for coordination in sustainability and AI regulation, especially in the absence of strong international leadership. Ultimately, he believes that businesses must earn society’s support to thrive in an increasingly turbulent world.\nWhy does this matter?\nInclusive Capitalism and Wealth Redistribution: Niinami’s call for corporations to redistribute wealth to those negatively impacted by globalization resonates with broader discussions on ethical AI and societal impact. As AI-driven automation potentially exacerbates economic disparities, his perspective prompts reflection on the responsibilities of companies developing and deploying these technologies to mitigate potential negative consequences and ensure equitable distribution of benefits.\nGeopolitical Risks and Global Coordination: Niinami’s concerns about geopolitical risks, particularly regarding China and unregulated AI, highlight the importance of international cooperation and ethical considerations in technology development. The potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes, including the risk of autonomous weapons systems, underscores the need for global governance frameworks and ethical guidelines to prevent misuse and ensure responsible innovation.\nRead more\n\nTrump, Putin discuss ways to end war in Ukraine in 2-hour phone call\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nThe article reports that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Putin characterized the call as “meaningful, frank, and very useful,” indicating Russia’s willingness to work with Ukraine on a potential peace treaty and ceasefire. Trump stated the call went “very well,” and suggested that Kyiv and Moscow would “immediately” begin peace negotiations. Despite this reported diplomatic activity, Ukraine reported Russia launched its largest drone attack since the war began.\nWhy does this matter?\nGeopolitical Implications: The direct communication between Trump and Putin regarding the war in Ukraine has significant implications for international relations and the future of the conflict. If the claims are true that peace talks will “immediately” begin, this could signal a potential shift in diplomatic strategy and potentially alter the trajectory of the war. However, the drone strike suggests otherwise, and that regardless of diplomatic talks the war will continue.\nPotential for Misinformation: Trump’s claim that negotiations will “immediately” begin should be monitored for its accuracy and potential to influence public opinion. Claims made during and after the phone call should be vetted for misinformation.\nRead more\n\nConcerns mount over US debt, inflation risks\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nThe article from Semafor reports growing concerns about the health of the U.S. economy, with U.S. stocks expected to fall and Treasury yields rising. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, stated that “the risks for US government debt are greater than the rating agencies are conveying.” Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, warned that markets were “underpricing geopolitical and inflation risks”. This follows last week’s downgrade of US Treasurys by Moody’s.\nWhy does this matter?\nEconomic Instability: The warnings from major figures like Dalio and Dimon, coupled with the Moody’s downgrade, suggest a potentially unstable economic future. The market’s apparent underestimation of geopolitical and inflation risks could lead to unexpected shocks and volatility.\nImpact on Investment: Increased risk in the US economy could impact the availability of funding for speculative technologies like AI. Further, economic instability can lead to a reprioritization of governmental and private spending, possibly away from long-term research.\nRead more\n\nG7 finance leaders meet amid trade tensions\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nG7 finance ministers are meeting in Canada amidst trade tensions and uncertainty over US tariffs. The Western alliance aims to present a united front on issues like the Ukraine war, China’s industrial capacity, and climate change. However, analysts anticipate that any consensus will likely align with US President Donald Trump’s priorities, making trade deals with Washington unlikely. As a result, the joint communiqué is expected to be vague, with ING warning that any deviation from previous foreign-exchange policy agreements could significantly impact the dollar’s value. Ahead of the talks, the euro rose to a 10-day high.\nWhy does this matter?\nThis article describes that international trade and foreign exchange policy are at odds, and agreement is unlikely given the current political climate. The stability of the dollar is a primary concern. The communique of the G7 finance leaders is anticipated to be vague because of conflicting priorities, which implies a lack of concrete action on critical global issues.\nRead more\n\nJapan’s exports to US fall as tariffs bite\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nJapan’s exports to the US experienced a decline in April, marking the first decrease this year, attributed to the impact of Washington’s tariffs and a slowdown in trade negotiations. As a key US trading partner, Japan is particularly susceptible to President Trump’s auto tariffs, yet both countries have not achieved a breakthrough in negotiations. Tokyo insists on the removal of tariffs, a position emphasized by its chief negotiator recently, fearing that making concessions would harm them electorally. Despite the stalemate, Japan’s position as the largest foreign holder of US debt provides leverage, suggesting that an agreement is likely to be reached eventually, given the importance of the relationship for both nations (“since it is too important for either side to have it end in failure” - Foreign Policy).\nWhy does this matter?\nGeopolitical Implications: The article highlights the potential risks of the current trade impasse between the US and Japan. The article also suggests that Japan’s position as a major holder of US debt can be a negotiating tool.\nInternational Relations: The stalemate in trade talks between the US and Japan demonstrates the complexities of international relations, where domestic political considerations (“making concessions would hurt them electorally”) can significantly influence trade policies and negotiations. Understanding these dynamics can provide insights into the challenges of fostering international cooperation and addressing global issues.\nRead more\n\nKyiv’s allies threaten further sanctions on Moscow ahead of Ukraine-Russia talks\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nWestern allies of Kyiv have threatened Russia with further sanctions if Moscow does not agree to a ceasefire in upcoming talks between the US, Russia, and Ukraine in Turkey. European foreign ministers joined Ukraine in calling on the Kremlin to agree to a ceasefire or risk additional restrictions. US Special Envoy Keith Kellogg also warned that Washington could levy new sanctions if the Kremlin does not agree to a truce with Ukraine: “Kellogg is expected to attend Thursday’s talks”. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he will be in Turkey and was prepared to meet directly with Vladimir Putin, but Russia is expected to send other officials.\nWhy does this matter?\nGeopolitical and Economic Ramifications: The threat of further sanctions highlights the ongoing economic pressure on Russia, which may influence its negotiating position and overall actions in the conflict. The success or failure of these talks and the imposition of further sanctions could have significant consequences for the global economy and international relations.\nFuture Policy Impact: The article highlights the potential for new sanctions based on Russia’s actions, which could inform future policy decisions regarding international conflict resolution and economic statecraft. The stated positions of key figures like Keith Kellogg and Volodymyr Zelenskyy provide insights into the diplomatic strategies being employed.\nRead more\n\nSanders adviser Stephanie Kelton praises Trump’s tax hike suggestion\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nThe article reports on Stephanie Kelton, an economic advisor to Bernie Sanders, supporting President Trump’s suggestion to let tax cuts expire for higher earners. Kelton argues that targeting the $1 million to $2.5 million income bracket with a 39.6% tax rate is “directionally correct” and “the right idea for mitigating the inflation risk.” She believes that cutting taxes on Social Security, tips, and overtime would be “likely to be stimulative” and increase the potential for inflation, so offsetting these cuts with targeted tax increases on higher earners would be prudent.\nKelton, known for her advocacy of Modern Monetary Theory, suggests that the top 10% of Americans account for a large proportion of consumer spending. Therefore, managing their consumption through taxes is a way to manage inflation. Trump’s willingness to consider higher taxes on the rich aligns with his “working-class Republican Party” rhetoric, although this position deviates from traditional Republican tax policy. Steve Bannon noted that this shift shows “how much we changed the electorate and how little we’ve changed the party.” Newt Gingrich, however, opposes any Republican shift toward higher taxes, warning of Republican in-fighting that the media would love to watch.\nWhy does this matter?\nThis article highlights a potential realignment in economic policy, where figures from opposite ends of the political spectrum find common ground. It also shows the complexities of economic policy, where seemingly simple decisions can have cascading effects on inflation, consumer spending, and political alliances. This potential alliance between factions within the Democratic and Republican parties could result in major changes in the future.\n\nRead more\n\nCuts at NOAA lead to new weather balloon technology at the agency\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nA Silicon Valley startup, WindBorne, will begin replacing NOAA’s weather balloons with AI-powered alternatives due to budget cuts enacted by the Trump administration at the recommendation of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These cuts forced staff reductions and program shutdowns within NOAA. WindBorne’s balloons, which can stay aloft for weeks using AI to control elevation and navigate wind currents, offer a potentially cost-effective solution for gathering weather data compared to traditional single-day balloons.\nWindBorne already provides data to NOAA, but the agency had previously been hesitant to expand the partnership. The company uses satellite connectivity and tiny motors to control ballast, enabling the AI to steer the balloons to specific locations for data collection. WindBorne aims to have 10,000 balloons in the air, providing global coverage. Currently, the data from its 50-60 balloons is purchased by traders for commodity price forecasting.\nJohn Dean, WindBorne’s CEO, stated that NOAA has shifted from a hands-off approach to one that is eager for partnerships. He believes the budget cuts, while “reckless,” may ultimately lead to more data collection. Former National Weather Service chief Louis Uccellini told PBS News that NOAA cuts could be disastrous for public safety, particularly as the country faces severe weather threats. However, one area where NOAA has aggressively cut is climate research.\nWhy does this matter?\nEfficiency and Innovation: The shift from traditional weather balloons to AI-powered alternatives highlights the potential for private sector innovation to improve government operations and reduce costs. Musk’s thesis that technology can improve efficiency may be justified.\nData Quality and Availability: While budget cuts may initially seem detrimental, the move towards WindBorne’s technology could lead to a greater volume of weather data. This could improve the accuracy and scope of weather forecasting models, benefiting various sectors from emergency services to commodity trading.\nPolitical and Economic Impacts: The article raises questions about the role of political agendas in shaping government policies, specifically concerning climate research. It also touches on the economic implications of government contracting practices and the potential for direct engagement with innovative startups.\nRead more\n\nRussia and Ukraine agree to prisoner swap in first direct talks since 2022\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nRussia and Ukraine engaged in their first direct peace talks since 2022, resulting in a significant prisoner swap involving 1000 prisoners of war from each side. While both countries remain divided on terms to end the conflict, particularly regarding territorial control, they’ve agreed to continue negotiations and document their visions for a ceasefire deal. According to Russia’s top negotiator, the Kremlin is “ready to continue contacts.” Russia expert Samuel Charap considered the agreement to continue negotiations “better than expected,” noting that expecting concrete results from the initial meeting would have been “shocking.”\nWhy does this matter?\nGeopolitical Implications: The resumption of direct talks, even without immediate breakthroughs, signifies a potential shift in diplomatic engagement. The agreement to continue negotiations and document ceasefire visions could lay the groundwork for future de-escalation efforts, however distant they may seem currently.\nEconomic Repercussions: The ongoing conflict and the potential for resolution directly affect global markets, resource availability, and economic stability. Any progress toward a ceasefire could lead to shifts in investment strategies and trade relations, while continued deadlock would prolong economic uncertainties.\nRead more\n\nTech companies are hiring fewer early career workers, report says\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nA recent report by SignalFire indicates a significant decrease in the hiring of early career workers by Big Tech and startups. These companies are hiring roughly half as many early career workers as a percentage of their total new hires compared to pre-pandemic levels. The report suggests that companies are increasingly filling lower-level positions with more experienced individuals. The year 2023 saw a brief surge in starting positions due to layoffs in senior roles, but this trend did not persist. The rise of AI tools capable of automating tasks traditionally performed by junior employees is expected to further exacerbate this situation. As the article says, “companies are posting lower-level roles and hiring more experienced [individuals] to fill them.” This creates a Catch-22 situation for young people seeking to gain experience in the tech industry.\nWhy This Matters\nIndustry Hiring Trends: The shift towards hiring more experienced individuals for lower-level roles in tech could reflect a greater need for immediate productivity and expertise, rather than investing in training early career employees. This trend could have implications for the talent pipeline and the long-term availability of skilled workers in the tech industry.\nImpact of AI on Entry-Level Roles: The increasing automation of tasks traditionally performed by junior employees may accelerate the decline in entry-level positions. This shift highlights the need to understand the extent to which AI tools are displacing early career workers, and the implications for workforce development and education.\nCatch-22 for Young Professionals: The difficulty for young professionals to gain experience due to companies prioritizing experienced hires presents a significant challenge. This Catch-22 calls for strategies to bridge the experience gap, such as internships, apprenticeships, or alternative pathways to entry-level positions.\nRead more\n\nInternational pressure mounts on Moscow to end Ukraine war\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nInternational pressure is building on Russia to end the war in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged new sanctions targeting those purchasing Russian oil and financial services. This sentiment is supported by the new German chancellor. Even former Kremlin sympathizer, US President Donald Trump, is reportedly growing impatient with Moscow’s “intransigence” (Financial Times). One of Trump’s allies has proposed a 500% tariff on countries that continue to buy Russian fuel, a plan that has surprisingly garnered bipartisan support. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to travel to Turkey for peace talks, with the intention of demonstrating to Trump that Vladimir Putin is the primary obstacle to achieving peace, as Putin has not yet committed to participating in these talks.\nWhy Does This Matter?\nGeopolitical Shifts: The shift in Trump’s stance toward Russia, coupled with bipartisan support for tariffs, signals a potential change in US foreign policy that could impact global alliances and trade relationships.\nEconomic Consequences: The proposed sanctions and tariffs could significantly affect the Russian economy and global energy markets, potentially leading to inflation and supply chain disruptions.\nDiplomatic Efforts: Zelenskyy’s efforts to engage in peace talks and demonstrate Putin’s unwillingness to compromise highlight the importance of diplomacy and international mediation in resolving the conflict.\nRead more\n\nUS approves first Alzheimer’s blood test\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nThe FDA has approved the first blood test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The test, developed by a Japanese biotech company, identifies proteins in the blood that suggest the presence of amyloid plaques, a key indicator of Alzheimer’s. While the test cannot definitively diagnose the disease or provide a cure, experts believe it can be a valuable screening tool for adults aged 55 and older who are at risk, potentially accelerating diagnosis and treatment before severe symptoms like memory loss appear.\nWhy does this matter?\nThis development signifies a move towards less invasive and more accessible diagnostic tools for Alzheimer’s. The approval of a blood test could dramatically change the landscape of early detection and intervention, shifting from costly and complex procedures to more routine screenings. This advancement may also spur further research and development in the field of neurodegenerative disease diagnostics and treatments.\nRead more\n\nUK inflation jumps unexpectedly in April\n\nSource: Semafor\nSummary\nThe UK’s inflation rate unexpectedly jumped to 3.5% in April, exceeding the Bank of England’s target level by 1.5 percentage points. The largest drivers were increased household bill costs (water and energy), higher food prices, and a minimum wage increase. Chancellor Rachel Reeves expressed disappointment in the figures. The Bank of England’s chief economist suggested that interest rates may have been cut “too rapidly” since mid-2024. The economist also said long-term shifts in business pricing strategies and employee wage negotiations could sustain “inflation higher for longer” (The Guardian).\nIn related news, US inflation rose less than expected in April despite the implementation of President Trump’s tariffs. The consumer price index increased by 0.2% for the month, with the 12-month inflation rate at 2.3%. According to Morgan Stanley’s top US economist, there is typically a “lag time before [tariff hikes] change prices” (The Wall Street Journal). The New York Times noted that many businesses have imported goods ahead of the tariffs to avoid higher costs.\nWhy does this matter?\n\nEconomic Forecasting Challenges: The unexpected surge in UK inflation, despite efforts to manage it, emphasizes the complexities and potential inaccuracies in current economic forecasting models. External factors (such as tariffs) can cause unforeseen behavior in economic systems, which may call for new forecasting systems.\nLagged Effects of Policy: The US inflation report, coupled with the economist’s warning about lag time, highlights the delayed impact of policy decisions such as tariff implementations. These delays might require more sophisticated modeling to accurately predict outcomes and avoid unintended economic consequences.\nImpact of Minimum Wage: The article mentions a minimum wage increase as a contributing factor to inflation, which might be worth researching as it could be a possible negative side effect of the policy.\n\nRead more\nRelated Articles\n\nUS inflation rose less than expected in April, as analysts warn of future price hikes\n\n"},"05-Snippets/The-Hinge-of-History-Peter-Singer":{"slug":"05-Snippets/The-Hinge-of-History-Peter-Singer","filePath":"05 Snippets/The Hinge of History Peter Singer.md","title":"The Hinge of History Peter Singer","links":["tags/bootleg"],"tags":["bootleg"],"content":"2023-02-18 15:26\nTags: bootleg\n\nThe dangers of treating extinction risk as humanity’s overriding concern should be obvious. Viewing current problems through the lens of existential risk to our species can shrink those problems to almost nothing, while justifying almost anything that increases our odds of surviving long enough to spread beyond Earth.\nPRINCETON – Twelve years ago, during the International Year of Astronomy that marked the 400th anniversary of Galileo’s first use of a telescope, I wrote “The Value of a Pale Blue Dot” – a reflection on how astronomy has revealed a vast universe filled with an unimaginable number of stars, thus shrinking the significance of our sun and our planet. The “pale blue dot” refers to how the Earth appears in a 1990 photograph taken by the Voyager spacecraft as it reached the outer limits of our solar system. The essay suggests that the knowledge gained from astronomy “forces us to acknowledge that our place in the universe is not particularly significant.”\nA recent blog post by Holden Karnofsky has led me to reconsider that thought. Karnofsky is co-CEO of Open Philanthropy, a foundation that researches the best opportunities for philanthropic grant-making, and publishes the reasons for its decisions. Thinking about the long-term significance of today’s philanthropic decisions is therefore part of Karnofsky’s role. He is thinking very long term indeed.\nKarnofsky points out that we could be living “at the very beginning of the tiny sliver of time during which the galaxy goes from nearly lifeless to largely populated.” That “tiny sliver of time” began, we might say, with the first use of tools by our ancestors, around three million years ago. It will end when our descendants – who might be digital minds, rather than biological organisms – inhabit the entire galaxy, perhaps ushering in a civilization consisting of an enormous number of conscious beings that would last for tens of billions of years. There is a good chance, Karnofsky argues, that this process of populating the galaxy will begin during this century. By 2100, we could develop the technology to construct self-sufficient settlements on other planets.\nThis thought echoes one expressed in 2011 by the late philosopher Derek Parfit, who wrote, near the end of the second volume of On What Matters: “We live during the hinge of history.” Like Karnofsky, Parfit was thinking of the arrival of technologies that, if used wisely, would enable our species to survive “its most dangerous and decisive period,” and our descendants to spread through our galaxy. Parfit refers to “the next few centuries,” rather than just this one, as the time it may take before humans can live independently on other planets, but even that will be only be a sliver of time compared to what is to come. Our most significant contribution to this development would be to ensure the survival of intelligent life on our planet.\nPerhaps, though, the idea that we are essential to this process is merely the latest version of the self-important delusion that humans are the center of existence. Surely, in this vast universe, there must be other forms of intelligent life, and if we don’t populate the Milky Way galaxy, someone else will.\nYet, as the physicist Enrico Fermi once asked fellow scientists over lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory, “Where is everybody?” He wasn’t commenting on empty tables in the lab’s dining room, but on the absence of any evidence of the existence of extraterrestrials. The thought behind that question is now known as the Fermi Paradox: if the universe is so stupendous, and has existed for 13.7 billion years, why haven’t other intelligent forms of life made contact?\nKarnofsky draws on a 2018 paper by researchers at the University of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute to suggest that the most likely answer is that intelligent life is extremely rare. It is so rare that that we may be the only intelligent beings in our galaxy, and perhaps in the much larger Virgo supercluster to which our galaxy belongs.\nThis is what Karnofsky means when he says that the future of humanity is “wild.” The idea that we, the inhabitants of this pale blue dot at this particular moment, are making choices that will determine whether billions of stars are populated, for billions of years, does seem wild. But it could be true. Granting that, however, what should we do about it?\nKarnofsky does not draw any ethical conclusions from his speculations, other than advocating “seriousness about the enormous potential stakes.” But, as Phil Torres has pointed out, viewing current problems – other than our species’ extinction – through the lens of “longtermism” and “existential risk” can shrink those problems to almost nothing, while providing a rationale for doing almost anything to increase our odds of surviving long enough to spread beyond Earth. Marx’s vision of communism as the goal of all human history provided Lenin and Stalin with a justification for their crimes, and the goal of a “Thousand-Year Reich” was, in the eyes of the Nazis, sufficient reason for exterminating or enslaving those deemed racially inferior.\nI am not suggesting that any present exponents of the hinge of history idea would countenance atrocities. But then, Marx, too, never contemplated that a regime governing in his name would terrorize its people. When taking steps to reduce the risk that we will become extinct, we should focus on means that also further the interests of present and near-future people. If we are at the hinge of history, enabling people to escape poverty and get an education is as likely to move things in the right direction as almost anything else we might do; and if we are not at that critical point, it will have been a good thing to do anyway.\nFrom project-syndicate.org"},"08-Old-notes/Pegasus-replication-problems-Wenda":{"slug":"08-Old-notes/Pegasus-replication-problems-Wenda","filePath":"08 Old notes/Pegasus replication problems Wenda.md","title":"Pegasus replication problems Wenda","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"2022-05-02 11:58\nTags:\n\nCurrent steps:\n\ncheck preprocessing and current train code\ngithub.com/xu1998hz/factual_score/blob/main/train/train.py\n\nline 154 can comment out output_norms=True in order to convert to normal pytorch\n\n\nPort to lightning/wandb workflow\nSpacy integration for entity extraction/linking via wikidata\n\nCNN/DM dataset\n\nFirst we get 1st order wikidata matches then we can do matching\nOne library can do this step with poor coverage\n\nChanging the objective:\n\nHow do we do query on all edges outgoing from a node\nWe want to reproduce a paper with no public data/code “Faithful to the Document or to the World?” by Dong, Wieting, Verga\n\nTable 1 connecting the indirectly related entities like they show\nWe really want to reproduce their KG and be able to release it\n\n\n"},"08-Old-notes/Plans-(summarization-5-4-22)":{"slug":"08-Old-notes/Plans-(summarization-5-4-22)","filePath":"08 Old notes/Plans (summarization 5-4-22).md","title":"Plans (summarization 5-4-22)","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Plans\n2022-05-04 16:09\nTags:\n\nDatasets\nCNN-Dailymail\nDemonstrate train/test diff\nInvestigate differing ROUGE, SMATCH score\nMy focus:\n\nGigawords on PEGASUS\n"},"09-Language/中文-vocab":{"slug":"09-Language/中文-vocab","filePath":"09 Language/中文 vocab.md","title":"中文 vocab","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"冷笑话 stupid joke\n好笑话\n一点儿不好笑\n一定要 →必ず\n扯淡→bullshit"},"09-Language/日本語/Lost-Stars-Words":{"slug":"09-Language/日本語/Lost-Stars-Words","filePath":"09 Language/日本語/Lost Stars Words.md","title":"Lost Stars Words","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"2025-05-23\nVol 2 ch 1-2\n指示　しじ\n人質　ひとじち\n破壊　はかい\n親友　しんゆう\n想像　そうぞう\n敵う　かな\n達する　たっ　reach, arrive\n差　さ　difference, variation\n「圧倒的な力見せるしかない」re: Death Star hitting the rebels lmao\n犠牲　ぎせい　sacrifice\n殻　から　\n溝　みぞ ditch, trench, gutter\n潰す　つぶ smash flatten\n低い\n非常に\n致命　ちめい　fatal\n小規模 しょうきぼ small scale\n迎え\n絶対\n乗り越える\n放棄\n逃亡"},"09-Language/日本語/単語":{"slug":"09-Language/日本語/単語","filePath":"09 Language/日本語/単語.md","title":"単語","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"低→ひく\n沈む→しずむ\n胴体→どうたい\n抜ける→ぬける\n一匹だけ、飛び込むときにロボットから体が抜けてしまった魚が降りました。\n印象\n普段\n動揺→どうよう\n解決\n耕す→たがやす\n問い→とい\n税→ぜい\n探る→さぐる\n投稿集団\n歩道横断\n触れる\nそれは四宮が今日触れたものか？No.\n所有\n４ それ は 四宮 が 所有 し て いる もの か ？‌\n巻き込む\n過度に接触\nいけ ませ ん ね 人 と の 接触 を 過度 に 恐れる‌\n初体験\n“ 初体験 は いつ だった アンケート ”‌\nリアクションが薄いですね…やっぱり私はこういうのは似合わないみたいです!\n\nこの会長の姿を残してさしあげなくては… (nekomimi pic)\n産業用部品\n分野（subfield) of 法律\n証拠\n探偵\n親台湾\n放任主義\n修士\n環境\n寄る (on the way, stopping by)\n立て看板 protests signs etc wikipedia\n暮らしやすい　not 　生き辛い\n新鮮 same in mandarin\n高速道路こうそこどおろ highway\n塞ぐふさぐblock/stop up/obstruct\n譲る・ゆずる hand over, assign\n転勤\nマイケルさんはどうやって日本語を勉強しているんですか?

The repo is directly runnable with npx\ngit clone github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git\ncd quartz\nnpm -i\nnpx quartz create\nIn the setup wizard, you specify where your quartz dir is. I recommend simlinking to the dir your library already lives in.\nVerify you can build as is with:\nnpx build quartz --serve\nConfiguring the hosting repo\nI host my notes on github pages as a project page repo. See guide for Creating a Github pages site\nI cloned that repo adjacent to my quartz repo as notes-page\nThen, you need to set up Quartz to use that web page repo as your target, and set up Quartz to use your page as the base URL.\nSo, edit quartz.config.ts with the following changes:\nconst config QuartzConfig = {\n\tconfiguration: {\n\t\tpageTitle: &quot;&lt;your name&gt;&#039;s Notes&quot;\n\t\t...\n\t\tbaseUrl: &quot;&lt;githubusername&gt;.github.io/&lt;repository&gt;&quot;\n\t\t...\n\t}\n}\nThen, you will use this as your core build command:\nnpx quartz build -o ../notes-page\nThis way the html gets spit out to notes-page. Then you can just sync w/ github to update the site.\nCustom URL\nIf you are using a custom url for your repo instead of &lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repo&gt;, you need to do two things:\n\nChange baseUrl in the config to that custom URL, in my case notes.mksx.xyz\nEnable the CNAME plugin in quartz.config.ts:\n\nconst config QuartzConfig = {\n\t...\n\tplugins: {\n\t...\n\temitters: {\n\t\tPlugin.CNAME()\n\t}\n\t}\n}\nNo further configuration is required. The necessary CNAME file corresponding to the desired URL (as specified in baseUrl) will be placed in the root dir.\nrobots.txt\nI don’t want Google etc to index my notes site since it’s full of random shit. To disable this add a robots.txt site to the root of your obsidian dir. Quartz copies static non md files automatically.\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /\n\nHidden subfolder\nSome of your notes are private. To prevent them from being synced, I place mine in a private folder called “00 Private” (in line with my numbered titling scheme to order my folders in local obsidian)\nThe ignorePatterns defines filenames containing any substring which will not get included. I added 00 Private and confirmed that these files don’t get synced\nEasy syncing\nNow that we have the live page up, I made some automation in order to have my custom sync pipeline accessible as a hotkey from inside obsidian. You need to have ssh-based authentication for git enabled for this to work.\nThis script performs the entire syncing process end-to-end:\n#!/bin/zsh\n \n# necessary to run as a command in obsidian because shell scripts don&#039;t have full init\nPATH=&#039;&lt;manually put your entire $PATH output here&gt;&#039;\n \ncd &lt;quartz dir&gt;\n \n### check if there has been a change to the library.\n \n# if previous content has doesn&#039;t exist, create it\ntouch content.hash\n \n# get the hash of all files in the obsidian library\nCONTENT_HASH=$(find content/* -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha1sum | sha1sum)\n \n# exit if there&#039;s been no change\nif [ &quot;$CONTENT_HASH&quot; = &quot;$(cat content.hash)&quot; ]; then\n  echo &quot;No change detected.&quot;\n  exit\nfi\n \necho CONTENT_HASH &gt; content.hash\n \n### a change has been detected; build and sync the library\n \n \nnpx quartz build -o ../notes-page\n \ncd ../notes-page/\n \n# manual interventions for things that don&#039;t copy over\ntouch .nojekyll # to speed up gh pages deployment\n \n# necessary for inside quartz for similar reasons (I think)\nGIT_SSH_COMMAND=&#039;ssh -i ~/.ssh/&lt;key&gt;&#039;\n \ngit add -A\ngit commit -m &quot;Obsidian update $(date)&quot;\n \ngit push\nVerify that this command works end-to-end.\nThen, you need to install the Shell Commands plugin in order to assign a hotkey to this script.\nI added this command: sh &lt;quartz dir&gt;/deploy.sh with the hotkey Cmd+Alt+S.\nWith one key, my entire notes dir syncs to notes.mksx.xyz!\n(The command takes about 5 seconds.)\nMy exact configs\nquartz.config.ts:\nimport { QuartzConfig } from &quot;./quartz/cfg&quot;\nimport * as Plugin from &quot;./quartz/plugins&quot;\n \n/**\n * Quartz 4 Configuration\n *\n * See quartz.jzhao.xyz/configuration for more information.\n */\nconst config: QuartzConfig = {\n  configuration: {\n    pageTitle: &quot;Michael&#039;s Notes&quot;,\n    pageTitleSuffix: &quot;&quot;,\n    enableSPA: true,\n    enablePopovers: true,\n    analytics: {\n      provider: &quot;plausible&quot;,\n    },\n    locale: &quot;en-US&quot;,\n    baseUrl: &quot;notes.mksx.xyz&quot;,\n    ignorePatterns: [&quot;private&quot;, &quot;templates&quot;, &quot;.obsidian&quot;, &quot;Private&quot;, &quot;00 Private&quot;],\n    defaultDateType: &quot;modified&quot;,\n    theme: {\n      fontOrigin: &quot;googleFonts&quot;,\n      cdnCaching: true,\n      typography: {\n        header: &quot;Schibsted Grotesk&quot;,\n        body: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;,\n        code: &quot;IBM Plex Mono&quot;,\n      },\n      colors: {\n        lightMode: {\n          light: &quot;#faf8f8&quot;,\n          lightgray: &quot;#e5e5e5&quot;,\n          gray: &quot;#b8b8b8&quot;,\n          darkgray: &quot;#4e4e4e&quot;,\n          dark: &quot;#2b2b2b&quot;,\n          secondary: &quot;#284b63&quot;,\n          tertiary: &quot;#84a59d&quot;,\n          highlight: &quot;rgba(143, 159, 169, 0.15)&quot;,\n          textHighlight: &quot;#fff23688&quot;,\n        },\n        darkMode: {\n          light: &quot;#161618&quot;,\n          lightgray: &quot;#393639&quot;,\n          gray: &quot;#646464&quot;,\n          darkgray: &quot;#d4d4d4&quot;,\n          dark: &quot;#ebebec&quot;,\n          secondary: &quot;#7b97aa&quot;,\n          tertiary: &quot;#84a59d&quot;,\n          highlight: &quot;rgba(143, 159, 169, 0.15)&quot;,\n          textHighlight: &quot;#b3aa0288&quot;,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: {\n    transformers: [\n      Plugin.FrontMatter(),\n      Plugin.CreatedModifiedDate({\n        priority: [&quot;frontmatter&quot;, &quot;git&quot;, &quot;filesystem&quot;],\n      }),\n      Plugin.SyntaxHighlighting({\n        theme: {\n          light: &quot;github-light&quot;,\n          dark: &quot;github-dark&quot;,\n        },\n        keepBackground: false,\n      }),\n      Plugin.ObsidianFlavoredMarkdown({ enableInHtmlEmbed: false }),\n      Plugin.GitHubFlavoredMarkdown(),\n      Plugin.TableOfContents(),\n      Plugin.CrawlLinks({ markdownLinkResolution: &quot;shortest&quot; }),\n      Plugin.Description(),\n      Plugin.Latex({ renderEngine: &quot;katex&quot; }),\n \n    ],\n    filters: [Plugin.RemoveDrafts()],\n    emitters: [\n      Plugin.AliasRedirects(),\n      Plugin.ComponentResources(),\n      Plugin.ContentPage(),\n      Plugin.FolderPage(),\n      Plugin.TagPage(),\n      Plugin.ContentIndex({\n        enableSiteMap: true,\n        enableRSS: true,\n      }),\n      Plugin.Assets(),\n      Plugin.Static(),\n      Plugin.NotFoundPage(),\n      // Comment out CustomOgImages to speed up build time\n      Plugin.CustomOgImages(),\n      Plugin.CNAME()\n    ],\n  },\n}\n \nexport default config\nFuture work\nI think I could make this whole process much more elegant with Github actions and the git plugin.
